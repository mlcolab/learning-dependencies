In general, binomial expansion is a mathematical method for expanding a binomial expression of the form (x + y)^n into a sum of terms that involve the powers of x and y. In linear algebra, binomial expansion is used to expand expressions involving linear transformations, which are functions that map one vector space to another in a way that preserves the linear structure of the vector space. Understanding how to perform binomial expansion is important for working with such expressions in linear algebra."

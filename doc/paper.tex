\title{Can language models be used to predict dependencies between knowledge components?}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\section{Introduction}
%% Why are we interested in learning dependencies?
% Problem of instructional sequencing: 
% Definition KCs
% Possible solution inference from user behavior (SOURCE) but has the disadvantage of disengaging users with mastered KCs or KCs that require further prerequisites (SOURCE about ZPD)
% Assumption: information about dependencies between KCs makes instructional sequencing more effective in terms of learning
% Definition: KC dependency (SOURCE)

% What can we contribute?
% 1. Extract KC dependencies from textbooks
% 2. Bypass textbook mining by querying a pre-trained language model to disclose relationships between KCs

% What is our research question?
% How well can langauge models predict dependencies between Knowledge Components compared to textbooks?

Imagine two real number lines crossing at a right angle at 0\\nas shown in Figure 1.3.1 .\\nThe horizontal number line is usually called the x-axis while the ver-\\ntical number line is usually called the y-axis . As with the usual number\\nline, we imagine these axes extending off indefinitely in both directions.\\nHaving two number lines allows us to locate the positions of points off of\\nthe number lines as well as points on the lines themselves.\\nF or example, consider the point P on the next page. T o use the num-\\nbers on the axes to label this point, we imagine dropping a vertical line\\nfrom the x-axis to P and extending a horizontal line from the y-axis to\\nP. This process is sometimes called ‘projecting’ the point P to the x-\\n(respectively y-) axis. W e then describe the point P using the ordered\\npair (2;\\x004). The first number in the ordered pair is called the abscissa\\norx-coordinate and the second is called the ordinate ory-coordinate .\\nT aken together, the ordered pair (2;\\x004) comprise the Cartesian coordi-\\nnates of the point P. In practice, the distinction between a point and its\\ncoordinates is blurred; for example, we often speak of ‘the point (2;\\x004). ’\\nW e can think of (2;\\x004) as instructions on how to reach P from the origin\\n(0;0) by moving 2units to the right and 4units downwards. Notice that\\nthe order in the ordered pair is important \\x00 if we wish to plot the point\\n(\\x004;2), we would move to the left 4units from the origin and then move\\nupwards 2units, as below on the right.\\nxy\\nP\\x004\\x003\\x002\\x001 1 2 3 4\\n\\x004\\x003\\x002\\x0011234\\nxy\\nP(2;\\x004)(\\x004;2)\\n\\x004\\x003\\x002\\x001 1 2 3 4\\n\\x004\\x003\\x002\\x0011234\\nWhen we speak of the Cartesian Coordinate Plane, we mean the set of\\nall possible ordered pairs (x; y)asxandytake values from the real num-\\nbers.

If a point other than the origin\\nhappens to lie on the axes, we typically refer to that point as lying on the\\npositive or negative x-axis (if y= 0 ) or on the positive or negative y-axis\\n(ifx= 0 ).

Such points do not belong to any of the four\\nquadrants.\\nDistance in the Plane\\nAnother important concept in Geometry is the notion of length. If we\\nare going to unite Algebra and Geometry using the Cartesian Plane, then\\nwe need to develop an algebraic understanding of what distance in the\\nplane means. Suppose we have two points, P(x0; y0)andQ(x1; y1);in\\nthe plane. By the distance dbetween PandQ, we mean the length of the\\nline segment joining P with Q. (Remember, given any two distinct points\\nin the plane, there is a unique line containing both points.) Our goal now\\nis to create an algebraic formula to compute the distance between these\\ntwo points. Consider the generic situation in Figure 1.3.3 (a).\\nWith a little more imagination, we can envision a right triangle whose\\nhypotenuse has length das drawn in Figure 1.3.3 (b).

As\\nyou may recall, the complex numbers fill an algebraic gap left by the\\nreal numbers. There is no real number xwith x2=\\x001, since for any\\nreal number x2\\x150. However, we could formally extract square roots\\nand write x=\\x06p\\x001. W e build the complex numbers by relabelling the\\nquantityp\\x001asi, the unfortunately misnamed imaginary unit . The\\nnumber i, while not a real number, is defined so that it plays along well\\nwith real numbers and acts very much like any other radical expression.\\nF or instance, 3(2i) = 6 i,7i\\x003i= 4i,(2\\x007i) + (3 + 4 i) = 5\\x003i, and so\\nforth. The key properties which distinguish ifrom the real numbers are\\nlisted below.\\nDefinition 2.1.1 The imaginary unit\\nThe imaginary unit isatisfies the two following properties:\\n1.i2=\\x001\\n2. Ifcis a real number with c\\x150thenp\\x00c=ipc\\nProperty 1 in Definition 2.1.1 establishes that idoes act as a square\\nroot of \\x001, and property 2 establishes what we mean by the ‘principal\\nsquare root’ of a negative real number. In property 2, it is important to\\nremember the restriction on c. F or example, it is perfectly acceptable to\\nsayp\\x004 =ip\\n4 =i(2) = 2 i. However,√\\n\\x00(\\x004)̸=ip\\x004, otherwise, we’d\\nget\\n2 =p\\n4 =√\\n\\x00(\\x004) =ip\\n\\x004 =i(2i) = 2i2= 2(\\x001) =\\x002;\\nwhich is unacceptable. The moral of this story is that the general prop-\\nerties of radicals do not apply for even roots of negative quantities. With\\nDefinition 2.1.1 in place, we are now in position to define the complex\\nnumbers .\\nDefinition 2.1.2 Complex number\\nA complex number is a number of the form a+bi, where aand\\nbare real numbers and iis the imaginary unit. The set of complex\\nnumbers is denoted C.\\nComplex numbers include things you’d normally expect, like 3 + 2 i\\nand2\\n5\\x00ip\\n3. However, don’t forget that aorbcould be zero, which\\nmeans numbers like 3iand 6are also complex numbers. In other words,\\ndon’t forget that the complex numbers include the real numbers, so 0and\\n\\x19\\x00p\\n21 are both considered complex numbers. W e want to study the\\narithmetic of complex numbers, but before we can do so, we first need to ChapterƉ TheComplexNumbers\\nmake sure we understand what it means for two complex numbers to be\\nequal.\\nDefinition 2.1.3 Equality of complex numbers\\nLetz=a+ib andw=c+id be two complex numbers. W e say\\nthatzandw are equal , and write z=w, if and only if a=cand\\nb=d.\\nThe arithmetic of complex numbers is as you would expect. The defi-\\nnitions of addition and multiplication are as follows:\\nDefinition 2.1.4 Addition of complex numbers\\nGiven two complex numbers z=a+ib andw=c+id, we define\\ntheir sum to be the complex number given by\\nz+w= (a+c) +i(b+d):\\nDefinition 2.1.5 Multiplication of complex numbers\\nGive two complex numbers z=a+ib andw=c+id, we define\\ntheir product to be the complex number\\nzw= (ac\\x00bd) +i(ad+bc):\\nAddition of complex numbers is defined by simply adding the corre-\\nsponding parts. The definition of multiplication looks complicated, but\\nit’s simply an application of the “F.O.I.L. ” rule for multiplying binomials,\\nwhere we have to account for the fact that i2=\\x001. As long as we re-\\nmember the two properties in Definition 2.1.1 , we can treat expressions\\ninvolving i=p\\x001as we would with any other radical. Let’s work through\\nan example to see how this works.\\nExample Ɖ.ƈ.ƈ Arithmetic with complex numbers\\nPerform the indicated operations.\\n1.(1\\x002i)\\x00(3 + 4 i)\\n2.(1\\x002i)(3 + 4 i)\\n3.1\\x002i\\n3\\x004i4.p\\x003p\\x0012\\n5.√\\n(\\x003)(\\x0012)\\n6.(x\\x00[1 + 2 i])(x\\x00[1\\x002i])\\nSolution\\n1.

The proofs of these properties\\ncan best be achieved by writing out z=a+bi andw=c+di for real\\nnumbers a,b,candd. Next, we compute the left and right sides of each\\nequation and verify that they are the same.\\nV erifying the first property is a very quick exercise.

But how do we know if a general polynomial has any complex\\nzeros at all? W e have many examples of polynomials with no real zeros.\\nCan there be polynomials with no zeros whatsoever? The answer to that\\nlast question is “No. ” and the theorem which provides that answer is The\\nF undamental Theorem of Algebra.\\nTheorem 2.1.4 The F undamental Theorem of Algebra\\nSuppose fis a polynomial function with complex number coeffi-\\ncients of degree n\\x151, then fhas at least one complex zero.\\nThe F undamental Theorem of Algebra is an example of an ‘existence’\\ntheorem in Mathematics.

Recall that a complex number is a number of the form\\nz=a+bi where aandbare real numbers and iis the imaginary unit\\ndefined by i=p\\x001. The number ais called the real part ofz, denoted\\nRe(z), while the real number bis called the imaginary part ofz, denoted\\nIm(z).\\nT o start off this section, we associate each complex number z=a+bi\\nwith the point (a; b)on the coordinate plane. In this case, the x-axis is\\nrelabelled as the real axis , which corresponds to the real number line\\nas usual, and the y-axis is relabelled as the imaginary axis , which is\\ndemarcated in increments of the imaginary unit i. The plane determined\\nby these two axes is called the complex plane .\\nReal AxisImaginary Axis\\n(\\x004;2) !z=\\x004 + 2i\\n(0;\\x003) !z=\\x003i(3;0) !z= 3\\n0\\x004\\x003\\x002\\x001 1 2 3 4\\n\\x004i\\x003i\\x002i\\x00ii2i3i4i\\nFigureƉ.Ɗ.ƈ:Thecomplexplane\\nSince the ordered pair (a; b)gives the rectangular coordinates associ-\\nated with the complex number z=a+bi, the expression z=a+bi is\\ncalled the rectangular form ofz. Of course, we could just as easily\\nassociate zwith a pair of polar coordinates (r; \\x12). Although it is not as\\nstraightforward as the definitions of Re (z)and Im (z), we can still give r\\nand\\x12special names in relation to z.\\nDefinition 2.3.1 The Modulus and Argument of Com-\\nplex Numbers\\nLetz=a+bi be a complex number with a= Re(z)andb= Im(z).\\nLet (r; \\x12)be a polar representation of the point with rectangular\\ncoordinates (a; b)where r\\x150.\\n• The modulus ofz, denoted jzj, is defined by jzj=r.\\n• The angle \\x12is an argument ofz. The set of all arguments\\nofzis denoted arg (z).\\n• Ifz̸= 0 and\\x00\\x19 < \\x12 \\x14\\x19, then \\x12is the principal argument\\nofz, written \\x12= Arg(z).\\nƊƌ F or the purposes of Math 1410, it suf-\\nfices to speak of “an” argument of z,\\nand choose whatever interval is con-\\nvenient for a given problem. The one\\nexception to this is online home-\\nwork : the easiest way to program a\\ncomputer to grade the answer for a\\nproblem on the polar form of a com-\\nplex number is to specify an interval\\nfor the argument, so be sure to read\\nany online homework problems care-\\nfully , and choose \\x12to lie in the ap-\\npropriate interval.\\nWhile we can always use the relation-\\nship tan \\x12=y\\nxto determine a value\\nfor the argument of z=x+iy, it is\\nmuch easier in practice to “factor out”\\nthe modulus, and then try to iden-\\ntify what’s left over as a point on the\\nunit circle.

W e know from Sec-\\ntion 2.2 that every point in the plane has infinitely many polar coordinate\\nrepresentations (r; \\x12). Thus, if we want to speak of “the” argument, we\\ncan’t simply choose one value of \\x12that works: there are infinitely many\\nother possible answers.\\nOne option, as given above, is to simply include al l possible answers.\\nThis idea becomes important if one wants to do calculus with complex\\nnumbers, but doesn’t play a role in the algebraic considerations we’re\\ninterested in. The other, also seen above, is to specify an interval of\\nlength 2\\x19in which the argument must lie. The interval (\\x00\\x19; \\x19], as given\\nabove, is a common choice; another is to use the interval [0;2\\x19).\\nF or this course we won’t worry much about distinguishing between\\n“argument” and “principal argument”: any value of \\x12that gives the correct\\ncomplex number will do. While this ambiguity may be annoying at times,\\nwe’ll see at the end of this section that being able to add an integer\\nmultiple of 2\\x19to the argument without changing the value of zgives us\\nan ingenious method for computing roots of complex numbers.\\nLet us explore this new terminology with an example.\\nExample Ɖ.Ɗ.ƈ Components of a complex number\\nF or each of the following complex numbers find Re (z), Im (z),jzj, arg (z)\\nand Arg (z).

It is time for an example.\\nExample Ɖ.Ɗ.Ɖ Converting between rectangular and polar form\\n1. Find the rectangular form of the following complex numbers. Find\\nRe(z)and Im (z).\\n(a)z= 4 cis(2\\x19\\n3)\\n(b)z= 2 cis(\\n\\x003\\x19\\n4)(c)z= 3 cis(0)\\n(d)z= cis(\\x19\\n2)\\n2.

In light of Theorem\\n2.3.3 , one can make sense of the polar\\nform using Euler’s formula\\nei\\x12= cos(\\x12) +isin(\\x12):\\nThe appearance of the exponential\\nfunction in this context might seem\\nstrange, but note that the three prop-\\nerties in Theorem 2.3.3 can then be\\nunderstood in terms of laws of expo-\\nnents. If z=rei\\x0bandw=sei\\x0c, we\\nhave\\nzw= (rs)(\\nei\\x0bei\\x0c)\\n= (rs)ei(\\x0b+\\x0c);\\nzn=rn(ei\\x0b)n=rnein\\x0b;\\nand so on. F or more details, see Ex-\\nercise 82.ChapterƉ TheComplexNumbers\\nSolution\\n1. The key to this problem is to write out cis (\\x12)as cos (\\x12) +isin(\\x12).\\n(a) By definition, z= 4 cis(2\\x19\\n3)\\n= 4[\\ncos(2\\x19\\n3)\\n+isin(2\\x19\\n3)]\\n. After\\nsome simplifying, we get z=\\x002 + 2 ip\\n3, so that Re (z) =\\x002\\nand Im (z) = 2p\\n3.\\n(b) Expanding, we get z= 2 cis(\\n\\x003\\x19\\n4)\\n= 2[\\ncos(\\n\\x003\\x19\\n4)\\n+isin(\\n\\x003\\x19\\n4)]\\n.\\nF rom this, we find z=\\x00p\\n2\\x00ip\\n2, so Re (z) =\\x00p\\n2 = Im(z).\\n(c) W e get z= 3 cis(0) = 3 [ cos(0) + isin(0)] = 3 . W riting 3 =\\n3 + 0 i, we get Re (z) = 3 and Im (z) = 0 , which makes sense\\nseeing as 3is a real number.\\n(d) Lastly , we have z= cis(\\x19\\n2)\\n= cos(\\x19\\n2)\\n+isin(\\x19\\n2)\\n=i. Since\\ni= 0 + 1 i, we get Re (z) = 0 and Im (z) = 1 . Since iis called\\nthe ‘imaginary unit,’ these answers make perfect sense.\\n2. T o write a polar form of a complex number z, we need two pieces\\nof information: the modulus jzjand an argument (not necessarily\\nthe principal argument) of z. W e shamelessly mine our solution to\\nExample 2.3.1 to find what we need.\\n(a) F orz=p\\n3\\x00i,jzj= 2 and\\x12=\\x00\\x19\\n6, soz= 2 cis(\\n\\x00\\x19\\n6)\\n. W e can\\ncheck our answer by converting it back to rectangular form to\\nsee that it simplifies to z=p\\n3\\x00i.\\n(b) F orz=\\x002 + 4 i,jzj= 2p\\n5and\\x12=\\x19\\x00 arctan (2) . Hence,\\nz= 2p\\n5cis(\\x19\\x00 arctan (2)) . It is a good exercise to actually\\nshow that this polar form reduces to z=\\x002 + 4i.\\n(c) F orz= 3i,jzj= 3 and\\x12=\\x19\\n2. In this case, z= 3 cis(\\x19\\n2)\\n. This\\ncan be checked geometrically . Head out 3units from 0along the\\npositive real axis. Rotating\\x19\\n2radians counter-clockwise lands\\nyou exactly 3units above 0on the imaginary axis at z= 3i.\\n(d) Last but not least, for z=\\x00117 ,jzj= 117 and\\x12=\\x19. W e get\\nz= 117 cis(\\x19). As with the previous problem, our answer is\\neasily checked geometrically .\\nThe following theorem summarizes the advantages of working with\\ncomplex numbers in polar form.\\nTheorem 2.3.3 Products, Powers and Quotients Com-\\nplex Numbers in Polar F orm\\nSuppose zandw are complex numbers with polar forms z=\\njzjcis(\\x0b)andw=jwjcis(\\x0c).

First, the reader may not be sold on\\nusing the polar form of complex numbers to multiply complex numbers\\n– especially if they aren’t given in polar form to begin with. Indeed, a\\nlot of work was needed to convert the numbers zandw in Example 2.3.3\\ninto polar form, compute their product, and convert back to rectangular\\nform – certainly more work than is required to multiply out zw= (2p\\n3 +\\n2i)(\\x001 +ip\\n3) the old-fashioned way . However, Theorem 2.3.3 pays huge\\ndividends when computing powers of complex numbers. Consider how we\\ncomputed w5above and compare that to using the Binomial Theorem to\\naccomplish the same feat by expanding (\\x001 +ip\\n3)5. Division is tricky in\\nthe best of times, and we saved ourselves a lot of time and effort using\\nTheorem 2.3.3 to find and simplifyz\\nwusing their polar forms as opposed\\nto starting with2p\\n3+2i\\n\\x001+ip\\n3, rationalizing the denominator, and so forth.\\nThere is geometric reason for studying these polar forms and we would\\nbe derelict in our duties if we did not mention the Geometry hidden in\\nTheorem 2.3.3 . T ake the product rule, for instance. If z=jzjcis(\\x0b)\\nandw=jwjcis(\\x0c), the formula zw =jzjjwjcis(\\x0b+\\x0c)can be viewed\\ngeometrically as a two step process. The multiplication of jzjbyjwjcan\\nbe interpreted as magnifying the distance jzjfrom zto0, by the factor jwj.\\n(Assuming jwj>1.)

Let\\nus now solve this same problem using the machinery developed in this\\nsection. T o do so, we express z= 8 in polar form. Since z= 8 lies8units\\naway on the positive real axis, we get z= 8 cis(0) .

Once more, we plot the\\nroots, which in this case all lie on the unit circle.\\nNotice the geometric interpretation given in Figures 2.3.6 -2.3.9 . Essen-\\ntially , Theorem 2.3.4 says that to find the nthroots of a complex number,\\nwe first take the nthroot of the modulus and divide the argument by n.\\nThis gives the first root w0.

However, we’ll also see that\\nthe algebraic behaviour of vectors is\\nthe same in any dimension, including\\ndimension four or greater. The only\\nthing that changes is the number of\\ncoordinates involved. This is one of\\nthe great powers of mathematics: we\\nare aided by our visual imagination,\\nbut not limited by it.\\nFigure Ɗ.ƈ.ƈ: Ploࢰng the point P=\\n(2;1;3)inspace.Ɗ:Vectors\\nThis chapter introduces a new mathematical object, the vector . Defined\\nin Section 3.2 , we will see that vectors provide a powerful language for\\ndescribing quantities that have magnitude and direction aspects. A simple\\nexample of such a quantity is force: when applying a force, one is generally\\ninterested in how much force is applied (i.e., the magnitude of the force)\\nand the direction in which the force was applied. V ectors will play an\\nimportant role in many of the subsequent chapters in this text.\\nThis chapter begins with moving our mathematics out of the plane and\\ninto “space. ” That is, we begin to think mathematically not only in two\\ndimensions, but in three. With this foundation, we can explore vectors\\nboth in the plane and in space.\\nƊ.ƈ Introducࢢon to Cartesian Coordinates in Space\\nW e reviewed the two-dimensional Cartesian Plane in Section 1.3 . This is\\nthe familiar background on which much of your high school mathematics\\nplayed out, and it provides the setting for the Calculus of one variable\\nencountered in courses like Math 1010 and Math 1560.\\nWhile there is wonderful mathematics to explore in “2D,” we live in a\\n“3D” world and eventually we will want to apply mathematics involving\\nthis third dimension. In this section we introduce Cartesian coordinates\\nin space and explore basic surfaces. This will lay a foundation for much\\nof what we do in the remainder of the text.\\nEach point P in space can be represented with an ordered triple, P=\\n(a; b; c ), where a,bandcrepresent the relative position of P along the x-,\\ny- and z-axes, respectively . Each axis is perpendicular to the other two.\\nVisualizing points in space on paper can be problematic, as we are\\ntrying to represent a 3-dimensional concept on a 2–dimensional medium.\\nW e cannot draw three lines representing the three axes in which each line\\nis perpendicular to the other two. Despite this issue, standard conventions\\nexist for plotting shapes in space that we will discuss that are more than\\nadequate.\\nOne convention is that the axes must conform to the right hand rule .\\nThis rule states that when the index finger of the right hand is extended in\\nthe direction of the positive x-axis, and the middle finger (bent “inward” so\\nit is perpendicular to the palm) points along the positive y-axis, then the\\nextended thumb will point in the direction of the positive z-axis. (It may\\ntake some thought to verify this, but this system is inherently different\\nfrom the one created by using the “left hand rule. ”)\\nAs long as the coordinate axes are positioned so that they follow this\\nrule, it does not matter how the axes are drawn on paper. There are two\\npopular methods that we briefly discuss.\\nIn Figure 3.1.1 we see the point P= (2;1;3) plotted on a set of axes.\\nThe basic convention here is that the x-yplane is drawn in its standard\\nway , with the z-axis down to the left. The perspective is that the paper\\nrepresents the x-yplane and the positive zaxis is coming up, off the page.\\nThis method is preferred by many engineers. Because it can be hard to\\ntell where a single point lies in relation to all the axes, dashed lines have\\nbeen added to let one see how far along each axis the point lies. Figure Ɗ.ƈ.Ɖ: Ploࢰng the point P=\\n(2;1;3)inspacewithaperspecࢢveused\\ninthistext.\\nFigure Ɗ.ƈ.Ɗ: Ploࢰng points PandQin\\nExampleƊ.ƈ.ƈ.ChapterƊ Vectors\\nOne can also consider the x-yplane as being a horizontal plane in, say ,\\na room, where the positive z-axis is pointing up. When one steps back\\nand looks at this room, one might draw the axes as shown in Figure 3.1.2 .\\nThe same point P is drawn, again with dashed lines. This point of view is\\npreferred by most mathematicians, and is the convention adopted by this\\ntext.\\nMeasuring Distances\\nIt is of critical importance to know how to measure distances between\\npoints in space. The formula for doing so is based on measuring distance in\\nthe plane (see Key Idea 1.3.2 on Page 14), and is known (in both contexts)\\nas the Euclidean measure of distance.\\nDefinition 3.1.1 Distance In Space\\nLetP= (x1; y1; z1)andQ= (x2; y2; z2)be points in space. The\\ndistance D between P andQ is\\nD=√\\n(x2\\x00x1)2+ (y2\\x00y1)2+ (z2\\x00z1)2:\\nW e refer to the line segment that connects points P andQ in space as\\nPQ , and refer to the length of this segment as\\r\\rPQ\\r\\r. The above distance\\nformula allows us to compute the length of this segment.\\nExample Ɗ.ƈ.ƈ Length of a line segment\\nLetP= (1;4;\\x001) and let Q= (2;1;1). Draw the line segment PQ and\\nfind its length.\\nSolution The points P andQ are plotted in Figure 3.1.3 ; no\\nspecial consideration need be made to draw the line segment connecting\\nthese two points; simply connect them with a straight line. One cannot\\nactually measure this line on the page and deduce anything meaningful;\\nits true length must be measured analytically . Applying Definition 3.1.1 ,\\nwe have\\n\\r\\rPQ\\r\\r=√\\n(2\\x001)2+ (1\\x004)2+ (1\\x00(\\x001))2=p\\n14\\x193:74:\\nIntroduction to Planes in Space\\nThe coordinate axes naturally define three planes (shown in Figure\\n3.1.4 ), the coordinate planes : the x-yplane, the y-zplane and the x-z\\nplane. The x-yplane is characterized as the set of all points in space\\nwhere the z-value is 0. This, in fact, gives us an equation that describes\\nthis plane: z= 0 . Likewise, the x-zplane is all points where the y-value\\nis 0, characterized by y= 0 .\\nƌƉ FigureƊ.ƈ.ƌ:Theplane x= 2.\\nFigureƊ.ƈ.Қ: Sketchingtheboundariesof\\naregioninExample Ɗ.ƈ.Ɖ.Ɗ.ƈ IntroducࢢontoCartesianCoordinatesinSpace\\nthex-yplane they-zplane thex-zplane\\nFigureƊ.ƈ.Ƌ:Thecoordinateplanes.\\nThe equation x= 2 describes all points in space where the x-value is 2.\\nThis is a plane, parallel to the y-zcoordinate plane, shown in Figure 3.1.5 .\\nExample Ɗ.ƈ.Ɖ Regions defined by planes\\nSketch the region defined by the inequalities \\x001\\x14y\\x142.\\nSolution The region is all points between the planes y=\\x001and\\ny= 2 .

There are also many\\nother concepts we encounter daily that cannot be described with just one\\nnumber. F or instance, a weather forecaster often describes wind with its\\nspeed and its direction (“ : : : with winds from the south-east gusting up\\nto 30 mph : : : ”). When applying a force, we are concerned with both the\\nmagnitude and direction of that force. In both of these examples, direc-\\ntion is important. Because of this, we study vectors , mathematical objects\\nthat convey both magnitude and direction information.\\nOne “bare–bones” definition of a vector is based on what we wrote\\nabove: “a vector is a mathematical object with magnitude and direction\\nparameters. ” This definition leaves much to be desired, as it gives no\\nindication as to how such an object is to be used. Several other definitions\\nexist; we choose here a definition rooted in a geometric visualization of\\nvectors. (In later chapters we will instead focus on algebraic aspects of\\nvectors.) It is very simplistic but readily permits further investigation.\\nDefinition 3.2.1 V ector\\nA vector is a directed line segment.\\nGiven points P andQ (either in the plane or in space), we denote\\nwith\\x00 \\x00 !PQ the vector from P toQ. The point P is said to be the\\ninitial point of the vector, and the point Qis the terminal point .\\nThe magnitude ,length or norm of\\x00 \\x00 !PQ is the length of the line\\nsegment PQ :∥\\x00 \\x00 !PQ∥=∥PQ∥.\\nT wo vectors are equal if they have the same magnitude and direc-\\ntion.\\nFigure 3.2.1 shows multiple instances of the same vector. Each directed\\nline segment has the same direction and length (magnitude), hence each\\nis the same vector.\\nF ollowing typical (but potentially confusing) mathematical convention,\\nwe use R2(pronounced “r two”) to represent all the vectors in the plane\\n(as well as the plane itself), and use R3(pronounced “r three”) to represent\\nall the vectors in space, as well as three-dimensional space itself.\\nConsider the vectors\\x00 \\x00 !PQ and\\x00 !RS as shown in Figure 3.2.2 . The vectors\\nlook to be equal; that is, they seem to have the same length and direction.\\nIndeed, they are. Both vectors move 2 units to the right and 1 unit up\\nfrom the initial point to reach the terminal point. One can analyze this\\nmovement to measure the magnitude of the vector, and the movement\\nitself gives direction information (one could also measure the slope of the\\nline passing through P andQ orR andS). Since they have the same\\nlength and direction, these two vectors are equal.\\nThis demonstrates that inherently all we care about is displacement ;\\nthat is, how far in the x,yand possibly zdirections the terminal point is\\nfrom the initial point. Both the vectors\\x00 \\x00 !PQ and\\x00 !RS in Figure 3.2.2 have\\nƌƌ The component form of a vector al-\\nlows us to identify a point (a; b)(or\\n(a; b; c )) with the corresponding vec-\\ntor⟨a; b⟩(or⟨a; b; c⟩), so that vec-\\ntors and points contain essentially the\\nsame information, presented in differ-\\nent contexts. This is why mathemati-\\ncians don’t mind using the notation\\nRnto refer to both a set of vectors\\nand the set of points containing those\\nvectors.\\nCaution: The notation ⟨a; b; c⟩used\\nin this chapter for a vector is com-\\nmon in geometry , physics, and calcu-\\nlus, but in later chapters we will use\\ncolumn vector notation2\\n4a\\nb\\nc3\\n5to repre-\\nsent the same vector: see Section 3.7 .\\nThis notation is more natural in the\\ncontext of matrix algebra.\\n.....P\\n.P′\\n.R\\n.S\\n.\\x005\\n.5\\n.\\x005.5\\n.x\\n.y\\n(a)\\n(b)\\nFigureƊ.Ɖ.Ɗ:GraphingvectorsinExample\\nƊ.Ɖ.ƈ.ChapterƊ Vectors\\nanx-displacement of 2 and a y-displacement of 1.

F or instance, if the vectors ⃗ u\\nand⃗ vrepresent forces acting on a body , the sum ⃗ u+⃗ vgives the resulting\\nforce. Because of various physical applications of vector addition, the sum\\n⃗ u+⃗ vis often referred to as the resultant vector , or just the “resultant. ”\\nAnalytically , it is easy to see that ⃗ u+⃗ v=⃗ v+⃗ u. Figure 3.2.5 also\\ngives a graphical representation of this, using gray vectors. Note that the\\nvectors ⃗ uand⃗ v, when arranged as in the figure, form a parallelogram.\\nBecause of this, the Head to T ail Rule is also known as the Parallelogram\\nLaw: the vector ⃗ u+⃗ vis defined by forming the parallelogram defined by\\nthe vectors ⃗ uand⃗ v; the initial point of ⃗ u+⃗ vis the common initial point of\\nparallelogram, and the terminal point of the sum is the common terminal\\npoint of the parallelogram.\\nWhile not illustrated here, the Head to T ail Rule and Parallelogram\\nLaw hold for vectors in R3as well.\\nIt follows from the properties of the real numbers and Definition 3.2.3\\nthat\\n⃗ u\\x00⃗ v=⃗ u+ (\\x001)⃗ v:\\nThe Parallelogram Law gives us a good way to visualize this subtraction.\\nW e demonstrate this in the following example.\\nExample Ɗ.Ɖ.Ɗ V ector Subtraction\\nLet⃗ u=⟨3;1⟩and⃗ v=⟨1;2⟩:Compute and sketch ⃗ u\\x00⃗ v.\\nSolution The computation of ⃗ u\\x00⃗ vis straightforward, and we\\nshow all steps below.

While the definition gives no\\nhint as to why we would care about this operation, there is an amazing\\nconnection between the dot product and angles formed by the vectors.\\nBefore stating this connection, we give a theorem stating some of the\\nproperties of the dot product.\\nҚƍ Note: proving Theorem 3.3.1 is\\nstraightforward and left to the reader.\\nThe reader is reminded, however,\\nthat proofs must be general : choos-\\ning particular numbers for the vec-\\ntors⃗ u,⃗ v, etc. only shows that the\\nproperties hold for those particular\\nnumbers. Instead, one should write\\n⃗ u=⟨u1; u2; u3⟩,⃗ v=⟨v1; v2; v3⟩, etc.\\nand then proceed using the rules of al-\\ngebra for real numbers in Section 1.2 .\\nF or example, ⃗ u\\x01⃗ v=⃗ v\\x01⃗ usince\\n⃗ u\\x01⃗ v=u1v1+u2v2+u3v3\\n=v1u1+v2u2+v3u3\\n=⃗ v\\x01⃗ u;\\nand this argument is valid no mat-\\nter what values are substituted for the\\ncomponents of the two vectors.\\n..\\n⃗u.⃗v\\n.θ\\n(a)\\n(b)\\nFigureƊ.Ɗ.ƈ:Illustraࢢngtheangleformed\\nbytwovectorswiththesameiniࢢalpoint.\\nFigureƊ.Ɗ.Ɖ:ProvingTheorem Ɗ.Ɗ.ƉChapterƊ Vectors\\nTheorem 3.3.1 Properties of the Dot Product\\nLet⃗ u,⃗ vand⃗ wbe vectors in R2orR3and let cbe a scalar.\\n1.⃗ u\\x01⃗ v=⃗ v\\x01⃗ u Commutative Property\\n2.⃗ u\\x01(⃗ v+⃗ w) =⃗ u\\x01⃗ v+⃗ u\\x01⃗ w Distributive Property\\n3.c(⃗ u\\x01⃗ v) = (c⃗ u)\\x01⃗ v=⃗ u\\x01(c⃗ v)\\n4.⃗0\\x01⃗ v= 0\\n5.⃗ v\\x01⃗ v=∥⃗ v∥2\\nThe last statement of the theorem makes a handy connection between\\nthe magnitude of a vector and the dot product with itself. Our definition\\nand theorem give properties of the dot product, but we are still likely\\nwondering “What does the dot product mean ?” It is helpful to understand\\nthat the dot product of a vector with itself is connected to its magnitude.\\nThe next theorem extends this understanding by connecting the dot\\nproduct to magnitudes and angles. Given vectors ⃗ uand⃗ vin the plane,\\nan angle \\x12is clearly formed when ⃗ uand⃗ vare drawn with the same initial\\npoint as illustrated in Figure 3.3.1 (a). (W e always take \\x12to be the angle\\nin[0; \\x19]as two angles are actually created.)\\nThe same is also true of 2 vectors in space: given ⃗ uand⃗ vinR3with\\nthe same initial point, there is a plane that contains both ⃗ uand⃗ v. (When\\n⃗ uand⃗ vare co-linear, there are infinite planes that contain both vectors.)\\nIn that plane, we can again find an angle \\x12between them (and again,\\n0\\x14\\x12\\x14\\x19). This is illustrated in Figure 3.3.1 (b).\\nThe following theorem connects this angle \\x12to the dot product of ⃗ u\\nand⃗ v.\\nTheorem 3.3.2 The Dot Product and Angles\\nLet⃗ uand⃗ vbe vectors in R2orR3. Then\\n⃗ u\\x01⃗ v=∥⃗ u∥∥⃗ v∥cos\\x12;\\nwhere \\x12,0\\x14\\x12\\x14\\x19, is the angle between ⃗ uand⃗ v.\\nThe proof of Theorem 3.3.2 is an application of the Law of Cosines ,\\nusing the properties in Theorem 3.3.1 . Referring to Figure 3.3.2 , if we let\\na=∥⃗ u∥,b=∥⃗ v∥, and c=∥⃗ u\\x00⃗ v∥, then the Law of Cosines tells us that\\nc2=a2+b2\\x002ab cos(\\x12):\\nThus, we have\\n∥⃗ u\\x00⃗ v∥2=∥⃗ u∥2+∥⃗ v∥2\\x002∥⃗ u∥∥⃗ v∥cos\\x12\\n(⃗ u\\x00⃗ v)\\x01(⃗ u\\x00⃗ v) =⃗ u\\x01⃗ u+⃗ v\\x01⃗ v\\x002∥⃗ u∥∥⃗ v∥cos\\x12\\n⃗ u\\x01⃗ u\\x00⃗ u\\x01⃗ v\\x00⃗ v\\x01⃗ u+⃗ v\\x01⃗ v=⃗ u\\x01⃗ u+⃗ v\\x01⃗ v\\x002∥⃗ u∥∥⃗ v∥cos\\x12\\n\\x002⃗ u\\x01⃗ v=\\x002∥⃗ u∥∥⃗ v∥cos\\x12\\n⃗ u\\x01⃗ v=∥⃗ u∥∥⃗ v∥cos\\x12;\\nҚқ .....⃗u\\n.⃗v\\n.⃗w\\n.α\\n.β\\n.θ\\n.\\x005\\n.5\\n.2\\n.4\\n.6\\n.x\\n.yFigure Ɗ.Ɗ.Ƌ: Vectors used in Example\\nƊ.Ɗ.Ɖ.Ɗ.Ɗ TheDotProduct\\nas required.\\nWhen \\x12is an acute angle (i.e., 0\\x14\\x12 < \\x19 /2), cos \\x12is positive; when\\n\\x12=\\x19/2, cos\\x12= 0 ; when \\x12is an obtuse angle ( \\x19/2< \\x12\\x14\\x19), cos \\x12is\\nnegative.

Theorem 3.3.2 related the angle between two\\nvectors and their dot product; there is a similar relationship relating the\\ncross product of two vectors and the angle between them, given by the\\nfollowing theorem.\\nTheorem 3.4.2 The Cross Product and Angles\\nLet⃗ uand⃗ vbe vectors in R3.

Given ⃗ u and⃗ vinR3with the same\\ninitial point, point the index finger of your right hand in the direction\\nof⃗ uand let your middle finger point in the direction of ⃗ v(much as we\\ndid when establishing the right hand rule for the 3-dimensional coordinate\\nsystem). Y our thumb will naturally extend in the direction of ⃗ u\\x02⃗ v. One\\ncan “practice” this using Figure 3.4.1 . If you switch, and point the index\\nfinder in the direction of ⃗ vand the middle finger in the direction of ⃗ u, your\\nthumb will now point in the opposite direction, allowing you to “visualize”\\nthe anticommutative property of the cross product.\\nApplications of the Cross Product\\nThere are a number of ways in which the cross product is useful in\\nmathematics, physics and other areas of science beyond “just” finding a\\nvector perpendicular to two others. W e highlight a few here.\\nArea of a Parallelogram\\nIt is a standard geometry fact that the area of a parallelogram is\\nA=bh, where bis the length of the base and h is the height of the\\nparallelogram, as illustrated in Figure 3.4.2 (a). As shown when defining\\nthe Parallelogram Law of vector addition, two vectors ⃗ uand⃗ vdefine a\\nparallelogram when drawn from the same initial point, as illustrated in\\nFigure 3.4.2 (b). T rigonometry tells us that h=∥⃗ u∥sin\\x12, hence the area\\nof the parallelogram is\\nA=∥⃗ u∥∥⃗ v∥sin\\x12=∥⃗ u\\x02⃗ v∥; (Ɗ.ƌ)\\nқƉ .....⃗u\\n.⃗v\\n. 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 .1\\n.2\\n.3\\n.4\\n.5\\n.x.y(a)\\n(b)\\nFigure Ɗ.Ƌ.Ɗ: Sketching the parallelo-\\ngramsinExample Ɗ.Ƌ.Ƌ.\\n.....A\\n.B\\n.C\\n.\\n1.\\n2.\\n3.1\\n.2\\n.3\\n. x .y\\nFigureƊ.Ƌ.Ƌ:Findingtheareaofatriangle\\ninExampleƊ.Ƌ.ƌ.Ɗ.Ƌ TheCrossProduct\\nwhere the second equality comes from Theorem 3.4.2 .

Since\\nthe lever arm makes a 45◦angle with the horizontal and is 2ft long,\\nwe can state that ⃗ℓ= 2⟨cos45◦;sin45◦⟩=⟨p\\n2;p\\n2⟩\\n:\\nSince the force vector is perpendicular to the lever arm (as seen in\\nthe left hand side of Figure 3.4.8 ), we can conclude it is making an\\nangle of \\x0045◦with the horizontal.

Note how in\\nthe given parametrization of the line, t= 0 corresponds to the point P,\\nandt= 1 corresponds to the point Q. This relates to the understanding\\nof the vector equation of a line described in Figure 3.5.1 .

In space, given equations of two lines, it can\\nsometimes be difficult to tell whether the lines are distinct or not (i.e., the\\nsame line can be represented in different ways). Given lines ⃗ℓ1(t) =⃗ p1+t⃗d1\\nand⃗ℓ2(t) =⃗ p2+t⃗d2, we have four possibilities: ⃗ℓ1and⃗ℓ2are\\nthe same line they share all points;\\nintersecting lines share only 1 point;\\nparallel lines ⃗d1∥⃗d2, no points in common; or\\nskew lines ⃗d1∦⃗d2, no points in common.\\nƎƈ FigureƊ.ƌ.ƌ: SketchingthelinesfromEx-\\nampleƊ.ƌ.Ɗ.\\nW e say that a system of equations\\nwith no solution, such as the one in\\nExample 3.5.3 , is inconsistent .

Line\\nℓ1has the direction given by ⃗d1=⟨3;\\x001;1⟩and line ℓ2has the direction\\ngiven by ⃗d2=⟨4;1;2⟩. It should be clear that ⃗d1and⃗d2are not paral-\\nlel, hence ℓ1andℓ2are not the same line, nor are they parallel. Figure\\n3.5.5 verifies this fact (where the points and directions indicated by the\\nequations of each line are identified).\\nW e next check to see if they intersect (if they do not, they are skew\\nlines). T o find if they intersect, we look for tandsvalues such that the\\nrespective x,yandzvalues are the same. That is, we want sandtsuch\\nthat:\\n1 + 3t=x=\\x002 + 4s\\n2\\x00t=y= 3 + s\\nt =z= 5 + 2 s:\\nThis is a relatively simple system of linear equations.

An alternative way of computing the distance is to make use of the\\northogonal decomposition in Key Idea 3.3.1 .

Consider a piece of cardboard\\nwith a point P marked on it. One can take a nail and stick it into the\\ncardboard at P such that the nail is perpendicular to the cardboard; see\\nFigure 3.6.1\\nThis nail provides a “handle” for the cardboard. Moving the card-\\nboard around moves P to different locations in space. Tilting the nail\\n(but keeping P fixed) tilts the cardboard. Both moving and tilting the\\ncardboard defines a different plane in space. In fact, we can define a plane\\nby: 1) the location of P in space, and 2) the direction of the nail.\\nThe previous section showed that one can define a line given a point\\non the line and the direction of the line (usually given by a vector). One\\ncan make a similar statement about planes: we can define a plane in space\\ngiven a point on the plane and the direction the plane “faces” (using the\\ndescription above, the direction of the nail). Once again, the direction\\ninformation will be supplied by a vector, called a normal vector , that is\\northogonal to the plane.\\nWhat exactly does “orthogonal to the plane” mean? Choose any two\\npoints P andQ in the plane, and consider the vector\\x00 \\x00 !PQ . W e say a vector\\n⃗ nis orthogonal to the plane if ⃗ nis perpendicular to\\x00 \\x00 !PQ for all choices of\\nP andQ; that is, if ⃗ n\\x01\\x00 \\x00 !PQ = 0 for all P andQ.\\nThis gives us way of writing an equation describing the plane. Let P=\\n(x0; y0; z0)be a point in the plane and let ⃗ n=⟨a; b; c⟩be a normal vector to\\nthe plane.

Suppose (x; y; z )\\nis a point on the plane 5x+ 4y\\x007z= 7 from Example 3.6.2 . W e can\\ntreat the point (\\x001;3;0) where the lines ⃗ℓ1and⃗ℓ2intersect as our point\\nof reference on the plane. F rom this point, we can reach the point (x; y; z )\\nby first travelling some distance in the direction of ⃗d1(parallel to ⃗ℓ1), and\\nthen some distance in the direction of ⃗d2(parallel to ⃗ℓ2).

It tells us that to get from\\nthe origin (0;0;0) to the point (x; y; z )on the plane, we should first travel\\nto the point (\\x001;3;0) on the plane, and then move parallel to the lines ⃗ℓ1\\nand⃗ℓ2until we reach our point. This vector equation for a plane is not\\nparticularly useful in Science or Engineering applications, but it is useful\\nmathematically . In particular, if we wanted to describe a two-dimensional\\nplane in R4(or any higher-dimensional space), we would have to resort\\nto this method.

T o see this, we first compute the cross\\nproduct of the direction vectors ⃗d1=⟨3;\\x001;1⟩and⃗d2=⟨4;1;2⟩for the\\ntwo lines. W e find\\n⃗ n=⃗d1\\x02⃗d2=⟨\\x003;\\x002;7⟩;\\nwhich is the same as the cross product we computed in Example 3.5.8 .\\nSince ⃗ n is orthogonal to ⃗d1, the plane through the point (1;2;0) with\\nnormal vector ⃗ ncontains the line ℓ1. Similarly , the plane through (\\x002;3;5)\\nwith normal vector ⃗ ncontains ℓ2. W e now have our parallel planes.\\nThe next step is to realize that at this point, the problem is no different\\nfrom the one we solved in Example 3.6.6 : the distance from ℓ1toℓ2is\\nthe same as the distance between the parallel planes, and the distance\\nbetween parallel planes is equal to the distance between the first plane,\\nand any point on the second plane.\\nBy definition, the point P1= (1;2;0) onℓ1lies on the first plane, and\\nthe point P2= (\\x002;3;5) onℓ2lies on the second plane. W e compute the\\nvector\\x00 \\x00 \\x00 !P1P2=⟨\\x003;1;5⟩, and then find the projection of this vector onto\\n⃗ n, as in Example 3.6.6 .

There are many , many\\napplications of these fundamental concepts. Complex shapes can be mod-\\nelled (or, approximated ) using planes.

F or the vector ⃗ x, we check\\nthat 3 + 6 = 9 , so⃗ xhas the correct form, and indeed (with a bit of “guess\\nand check” work, we find that a=b=c= 1 works, since ⃗ u+⃗ v+⃗ w=⃗ x.\\nThus, we can conclude that\\n⃗ x2spanf⃗ u;⃗ v; ⃗ w g:\\nF or the vector ⃗ y, we add the first two components, getting 4+1 = 5 ̸=\\x003.\\nSince the third component is not the sum of the first two, there is no way\\nthat⃗ ycould belong to the span of ⃗ u,⃗ v, and ⃗ w.\\nLinear independence\\nNotice in Example 3.7.2 that the span did not change when we added\\nthe vector ⃗ wto the set of spanning vectors. This was probably not too\\nsurprising, since we saw that ⃗ w= 3⃗ u+⃗ v, meaning that ⃗ w is a linear\\ncombination of ⃗ uand⃗ v, and thus,\\n⃗ w2spanf⃗ u;⃗ vg:\\nW e don’t get anything new when we include the vector ⃗ wsince it lies in\\nthe plane spanned by ⃗ uand⃗ v. W e say that the vector ⃗ wdepends on⃗ uand\\n⃗ v, in the same way that the total of a sum depends on the numbers being\\nadded. Since this dependence is defined in terms of linear combinations,\\nwe say that the vectors ⃗ u;⃗ v; ⃗ w are linearly dependent . In general, a\\nset of vectors ⃗ v1; : : : ;⃗ v kis linearly dependent of one of the vectors can be\\nwritten as a linear combination of the others. If this is impossible, we say\\nthat the vectors are linearly independent . The formal definition is as\\nfollows.\\nƈƈƍ ChapterƊ Vectors\\nDefinition 3.7.4 Linear dependence\\nW e say that a set of vectors\\nA=f⃗ v1;⃗ v2; : : : ;⃗ v kg\\ninRnislinearly dependent if⃗02A, or if one of the vectors ⃗ vi\\ninA can be written as a linear combination of the other vectors in\\nA. If the set Ais not linearly dependent, we say that it is linearly\\nindependent .\\nExample Ɗ.ƍ.Ƌ Determining linear independence\\nDetermine whether or not following sets of vectors are linearly indepen-\\ndent:\\n1. The vectors ⃗ u=2\\n42\\n\\x001\\n13\\n5,⃗ v=2\\n43\\n2\\n53\\n5, and ⃗ w=2\\n4\\x002\\n5\\n33\\n5 from Example\\n3.7.3 .\\n2. The vectors\\n⃗ x=2\\n42\\n\\x001\\n03\\n5; ⃗ y=2\\n4\\x002\\n3\\n13\\n5; and ⃗ z=2\\n41\\n1\\n03\\n5:\\nSolution Like problems involving span, a general approach to an-\\nswering questions like these about linear independence will have to wait\\nuntil we develop methods for solving systems of equations in the next\\nchapter. However, for these two sets of vectors, we can reason our way to\\nan answer.\\n1. Here, we noticed that all three vectors satisfy the condition z=x+y,\\nif we label their respective components as x,y, and z. But this\\ncondition is simply the equation of a plane; namely , x+y\\x00z= 0 .\\nIntuition tells us that any plane can be written as the span of two\\nvectors, so we can expect that any one of the three vectors can be\\nwritten in terms of the other two, and indeed, this is the case. With\\na bit of guesswork (or by asking a computer), we can determine that\\n⃗ w=\\x0019\\n7⃗ u+8\\n7⃗ v;\\nshowing that ⃗ wcan be written as a linear combination of ⃗ uand⃗ v,\\nand thus, that our vectors are linearly dependent.\\n2. Here, we make the useful observation that two of our three vectors\\nhave zero as their third component. Since ⃗ xand⃗ zhave third compo-\\nnent zero, it is impossible for ⃗ yto be written as a linear combination\\nof⃗ xand⃗ z, since any such linear combination would still have a zero\\nin the third component. T o see that ⃗ xcannot be written in terms of\\n⃗ yand⃗ z, notice that for any aandb,\\na⃗ y+b⃗ z=2\\n4\\x002a+b\\n3a+b\\na3\\n5:\\nƈƈқ At this point in the text, we’re not\\nin a position to prove that any set of\\nfour vectors in R3(or more generally ,\\nkvectors in Rn, where k > n ) is au-\\ntomatically independent. However,\\nwe’ll soon see in Chapter 4that in this\\ncase, the test for independence given\\nby Equation (Ɗ.ƈқ)results in a “homo-\\ngeneous” system of linear equations\\nwith more variables than equations,\\nand that such a system is guaranteed\\nto have non-trivial solutions.Ɗ.ƍ TheVectorSpace Rn\\nIf this is to equal ⃗ x, then we must have a= 0 , giving us ⃗ x=b⃗ z, but\\nit’s clear that ⃗ xis not a scalar multiple of ⃗ z. A similar argument\\nshows that ⃗ zcannot be written in terms of ⃗ xand⃗ y, and thus our\\nvectors are linearly independent.\\nAnother way to characterize linear independence is as follows: suppose\\nwe have a linear combination equal to the zero vector:\\nc1⃗ v1+c2⃗ v2+\\x01\\x01\\x01+ck⃗ vk=⃗0: (Ɗ.ƈқ)\\nThis is always possible of course, since we can simply set each of the\\nscalars equal to zero. The condition of linear independence tells us that if\\nour vectors are independent, then this is the only way to obtain a linear\\ncombination equal to the zero vector.\\nT o see why this rule works, suppose we can choose our scalars in Equa-\\ntion(Ɗ.ƈқ)so that at least one of them is non-zero. F or simplicity , let’s say\\nc1̸= 0 . Then we can rewrite (Ɗ.ƈқ)as\\nc1⃗ v1=\\x00c2⃗ v2\\x00 \\x01\\x01\\x01 \\x00 ck⃗ vk;\\nand since c1̸= 0 , we can divide both sides by c1, and we’ve written ⃗ v1as\\na linear combination of the remaining vectors.\\nF or example, from Example 3.7.4 we can conclude (with a bit of rear-\\nranging) that the vectors ⃗ u,⃗ v, and ⃗ wsatisfy the relationship\\n19⃗ u\\x008⃗ v+ 7⃗ w=⃗0:\\nLinear independence can be a difficult concept at first, but in three\\ndimensions we can use Equation (Ɗ.ƈқ)to provide a visual interpretation\\non a case-by-case basis.\\nKey Idea 3.7.1 Linearly independent sets of vectors in\\nR3\\n• Any set f⃗ ugcontaining a single vector in R3is linearly de-\\npendent if ⃗ u=⃗0, and independent otherwise. (Here (Ɗ.ƈқ)\\nbecomes c⃗ u=⃗0. If⃗ u̸=⃗0, the only solution is to take c= 0 .)\\n• Any set f⃗ u;⃗ vgcontaining two non-zero vectors in R3is lin-\\nearly dependent if ⃗ uis parallel to ⃗ v, and independent other-\\nwise. (In other words, two dependent vectors lie on the same\\nline. T wo independent vectors span a plane.)\\n• Any set f⃗ u;⃗ v; ⃗ w gof three non-zero vectors in R3is linearly\\ndependent if all three vectors lie in the same plane, and inde-\\npendent otherwise.\\n• Any set of four or more vectors in R3is automatically linearly\\ndependent.\\nThis section introduced several new ideas. Some, like linear combi-\\nnations, are straightforward. Others, like span and linear independence,\\ntake some getting used to. There remain two very obvious questions to\\naddress:\\nƈƈƎ ChapterƊ Vectors\\n1. How do we tell whether or not a given vector belongs to the span of\\na set of vectors?\\n2. How do we tell if a set of vectors is linearly independent?\\nIt turns out that both questions lead to systems of linear equations .\\nAs we saw in Example 3.7.3 , we are currently unable to systematically\\nsolve such problems. In Chapters 4and 5we will develop the techniques\\nneeded to systematically solve such systems, at which point we will be\\nable to easily answer questions about linear independence and span.\\nT o see how such systems arise, suppose we want to know whether or\\nnot the vector ⃗ w=2\\n6642\\n\\x001\\n3\\n03\\n7752R4belongs to V= spanf⃗ v1;⃗ v2;⃗ v3g, where\\n⃗ v1=2\\n6640\\n2\\n\\x001\\n43\\n775;⃗ v2=2\\n6643\\n1\\n0\\n\\x0043\\n775;⃗ v3=2\\n664\\x003\\n6\\n7\\n23\\n775:\\nBy definition, V is the set of all possible linear combinations of the vectors\\n⃗ v1;⃗ v2;⃗ v3, so saying that ⃗ w2V is the same as saying that we can write ⃗ w\\nas a linear combination of these vectors. Thus, what we want to know is\\nwhether or not there exist scalars x1; x2; x3such that\\n⃗ w=x1⃗ v1+x2⃗ v2+x3⃗ v3:\\nSubstituting in the values for our vectors, this gives\\nx12\\n6640\\n2\\n\\x001\\n43\\n775+x22\\n6643\\n1\\n0\\n\\x0043\\n775+x32\\n664\\x003\\n6\\n7\\n23\\n775=2\\n6643x2\\x003x3\\n2x1+x2+ 6x3\\n\\x00x1+ 7x3\\n4x1\\x004x2+ 2x33\\n775=2\\n6642\\n\\x001\\n3\\n03\\n775:\\nSince two vectors are equal if and only if each component is equal, the\\nabove vector equation leads to the following system of four equations:\\n3x2\\x003x3= 2\\n2x1+x2+ 6x3=\\x001\\n\\x00x1 + 7x3= 3\\n4x1\\x004x2+ 2x3= 0\\nThus, the question “Is the vector ⃗ wan element of V?” is equivalent to\\nthe question “Is there a solution to the above system of equations?”\\nQuestions about linear independence are similar, but not quite the\\nsame. With the above example involving span, what we wanted to know\\nis “Does a solution exist?” With linear independence, it is not whether\\na solution exists that is in doubt, but whether or not that solution is\\nunique . F or example, suppose we wanted to know if the vectors in our\\nspan example above are linearly independent. W e would start with the\\nvector equation\\nx1⃗ v1+x2⃗ v2+x3⃗ v3=⃗0;\\nand ask whether or not there are any solutions other than x1=x2=x3=\\n0. This vector equation leads to a system just like the one above, except\\nthat the numbers to the right of the = signs would all be zeros. The\\nƈƉƇ Ɗ.ƍ TheVectorSpace Rn\\ntechniques needed to answer these and other questions will be developed\\nbeginning in Chapter 4.\\nBefore moving on to our study of systems of equations, however, we\\nneed to take some time to define matrix multiplication and explore\\nsome of its properties.\\nƈƉƈ Exercises 3.7\\nProblems\\nIn Exercises ƈ – Ƌ, simplify the given linear combinaࢢons,\\nwhere\\n⃗ u=2\\n664\\x001\\n0\\n2\\n43\\n775;⃗ v=2\\n6643\\n4\\n\\x005\\n03\\n775;and⃗ w=2\\n664\\x003\\n2\\n0\\n73\\n775:\\nƈ.3⃗ u\\x002⃗ v\\nƉ.\\x002⃗ u+ 3⃗ v+⃗ w\\nƊ.⃗ u\\x002⃗ v+ 5⃗ w\\nƋ.4⃗ v\\x003⃗ w\\nIn Exercises ƌ – қ, calculate the given quanࢢty, where\\n⃗ u=2\\n666642\\n0\\n\\x001\\n3\\n73\\n77775;⃗ v=2\\n66664\\x003\\n5\\n0\\n\\x006\\n13\\n77775;and⃗ w=2\\n666640\\n\\x003\\n5\\n2\\n\\x0043\\n77775:ƌ.∥⃗ v∥\\nҚ.⃗ u\\x01⃗ v\\nƍ.⃗ w\\x01(2⃗ u\\x003⃗ v)\\nқ.2(⃗ w\\x01⃗ u)\\x003(⃗ w\\x01⃗ v)\\nIn Exercises Ǝ – ƈƊ, determine if the given statement is true or\\nfalse.

In this chapter we will\\nuncover some of the fundamental principles guiding the solution to such\\nproblems.\\nSolving such systems was a bit time consuming, but not terribly dif-\\nficult. So why bother? W e bother because, in addition to the theoreti-\\ncal applications mentioned above, there are many , many , many practical\\napplications where systems of linear equations arise, from business and\\nfinance to engineering to computer graphics to understanding more math-\\nematics. And not only are there many applications of systems of linear\\nequations, on most occasions where these systems arise we are using far\\nmore than three variables. (Engineering applications, for instance, often\\nrequire thousands of variables.) So getting a good understanding of how\\nto solve these systems effectively is important.\\nƋ.ƈ Introducࢢon to Linear Equaࢢons\\nAS YOU READ : : :\\n1. What is one of the annoying habits of mathematicians?\\n2. What is the difference between constants and coefficients?\\n3.

Y ou are told that\\nthere are a total of 30 marbles in the jar; there are twice as many red\\nmarbles as green ones; the number of blue marbles is the same as the sum\\nof the red and green marbles. How many marbles of each colour are there?\\nSolution W e could attempt to solve this with some trial and er-\\nror, and we’d probably get the correct answer without too much work.\\nHowever, this won’t lend itself towards learning a good technique for solv-\\ning larger problems, so let’s be more mathematical about it.\\nLet’s let rrepresent the number of red marbles, and let bandgdenote\\nthe number of blue and green marbles, respectively . W e can use the given\\nstatements about the marbles in the jar to create some equations. Here’s another “What if?” question:\\nwhat if we had a total of 20 marbles\\nin the jar? Could we still solve the\\nproblem? Chances are that you can\\nstill work out a solution to the sys-\\ntem, but what does it mean? (In this\\ncase it’s probably safe to assume that\\nit doesn’t make physical sense to deal\\nwith fractions of a marble.)ChapterƋ SystemsofLinearEquaࢢons\\nSince we know there are 30 marbles in the jar, we know that\\nr+b+g= 30: (Ƌ.ƈ)\\nAlso, we are told that there are twice as many red marbles as green ones,\\nso we know that\\nr= 2g: (Ƌ.Ɖ)\\nFinally , we know that the number of blue marbles is the same as the sum\\nof the red and green marbles, so we have\\nb=r+g: (Ƌ.Ɗ)\\nF rom this stage, there isn’t one “right” way of proceeding. Rather,\\nthere are many ways to use this information to find the solution. One way\\nis to combine ideas from equations 4.2 and 4.3 ; in 4.3 replace rwith 2g.\\nThis gives us\\nb= 2g+g= 3g: (Ƌ.Ƌ)\\nW e can then combine equations 4.1 ,4.2 and 4.4 by replacing rin 4.1 with\\n2gas we did before, and replacing bwith 3gto get\\nr+b+g= 30\\n2g+ 3g+g= 30\\n6g= 30\\ng= 5 (Ƌ.ƌ)\\nW e can now use equation 4.5 to find randb; we know from 4.2 that\\nr= 2g= 10 and then since r+b+g= 30 , we easily find that b= 15 .\\nMathematicians often see solutions to given problems and then ask\\n“What if : : : ?” It’s an annoying habit that we would do well to develop\\n– we should learn to think like a mathematician. What are the right\\nkinds of “what if” questions to ask? Here’s another annoying habit of\\nmathematicians: they often ask “wrong” questions. That is, they often\\nask questions and find that the answer isn’t particularly interesting. But\\nasking enough questions often leads to some good “right” questions. So\\ndon’t be afraid of doing something “wrong;” we mathematicians do it all\\nthe time.\\nSo what is a good question to ask after seeing Example 4.1.1 ? Here\\nare two possible questions:\\n1. Did we really have to call the red balls “ r”? Could we call them “ q”?\\n2. What if we had 60 balls at the start instead of 30?\\nLet’s look at the first question. W ould the solution to our problem\\nchange if we called the red balls q? Of course not. At the end, we’d find\\nthatq= 10 , and we would know that this meant that we had 10 red balls.\\nNow let’s look at the second question. Suppose we had 60 balls, but the\\nother relationships stayed the same. How would the situation and solution\\nchange? Let’s compare the “original” equations to the “new” equations.\\nOriginal New\\nr+b+g= 30 r+b+g= 60\\nr= 2g r= 2g\\nb=r+g b=r+g\\nƈƉƋ Ƌ.ƈ IntroducࢢontoLinearEquaࢢons\\nBy examining these equations, we see that nothing has changed except\\nthe first equation. It isn’t too much of a stretch of the imagination to see\\nthat we would solve this new problem exactly the same way that we solved\\nthe original one, except that we’d have twice as many of each type of ball.\\nA conclusion from answering these two questions is this: it doesn’t\\nmatter what we call our variables, and while changing constants in the\\nequations changes the solution, they don’t really change the method of\\nhow we solve these equations.\\nIn fact, it is a great discovery to realize that all we care about are the\\nconstants and the coefficients of the equations. By systematically handling\\nthese, we can solve any set of linear equations in a very nice way . Before\\nwe go on, we must first define what a linear equation is.\\nDefinition 4.1.1 Linear Equation\\nA linear equation is an equation that can be written in the form\\na1x1+a2x2+\\x01\\x01\\x01+anxn=c\\nwhere the xiare variables (the unknowns), the aiare coefficients,\\nandcis a constant.\\nA system of linear equations is a set of linear equations that\\ninvolve the same variables.\\nA solution to a system of linear equations is a set of values for the\\nvariables xisuch that each equation in the system is satisfied.\\nSo in Example 4.1.1 , when we answered “how many marbles of each\\ncolour are there?,” we were also answering “find a solution to a certain\\nsystem of linear equations. ”\\nThe following are examples of linear equations:\\n2x+ 3y\\x007z= 29\\nx1+7\\n2x2+x3\\x00x4+ 17x5=3p\\n\\x0010\\ny1+ 142y4+ 4 = y2+ 13\\x00y1\\np\\n7r+\\x19s+3t\\n5= cos(45◦)\\nNotice that the coefficients and constants can be fractions and irra-\\ntional numbers (like \\x19,3p\\x0010 and cos (45◦)). The variables only come\\nin the form of aixi; that is, just one variable multiplied by a coefficient.\\n(Note that3t\\n5=3\\n5t, just a variable multiplied by a coefficient.) Also, it\\ndoesn’t really matter what side of the equation we put the variables and\\nthe constants, although most of the time we write them with the variables\\non the left and the constants on the right.\\nW e would not regard the above collection of equations to constitute a\\nsystem of equations, since each equation uses differently named variables.\\nƈƉƌ ChapterƋ SystemsofLinearEquaࢢons\\nAn example of a system of linear equations is\\nx1\\x00x2+x3+x4= 1\\n2x1+ 3x2+x4= 25\\nx2+x3= 10\\nIt is important to notice that not all equations used all of the vari-\\nables (it is more accurate to say that the coefficients can be 0, so the last\\nequation could have been written as 0x1+x2+x3+ 0x4= 10 ). Also,\\njust because we have four unknowns does not mean we have to have four\\nequations. W e could have had fewer, even just one, and we could have\\nhad more.\\nT o get a better feel for what a linear equation is, we point out some\\nexamples of what are not linear equations.\\n2xy+z= 1\\n5x2+ 2y5= 100\\n1\\nx+py+ 24z= 3\\nsin2x1+cos2x2= 29\\n2x1+lnx2= 13\\nThe first example is not a linear equation since the variables xandy\\nare multiplied together. The second is not a linear equation because the\\nvariables are raised to powers other than 1; that is also a problem in the\\nthird equation (remember that 1/x=x\\x001andpx=x1/2). Our variables\\ncannot be the argument of function like sin, cos or ln, nor can our variables\\nbe raised as an exponent.\\nAt this stage, we have yet to discuss how to efficiently find a solution\\nto a system of linear equations. That is a goal for the upcoming sections.\\nRight now we focus on identifying linear equations. It is also useful to\\n“limber” up by solving a few systems of equations using any method we\\nhave at hand to refresh our memory about the basic process.\\nƈƉҚ Exercises 4.1\\nProblems\\nIn Exercises ƈ – ƈƇ, state whether or not the given equaࢢon is\\nlinear.\\nƈ.x+y+z= 10\\nƉ.xy+yz+xz= 1\\nƊ.\\x003x+ 9 = 3 y\\x005z+x\\x007\\nƋ.p\\n5y+\\x19x=\\x001\\nƌ.(x\\x001)(x+ 1) = 0\\nҚ.√\\nx2\\n1+x2\\n2= 25\\nƍ.x1+y+t= 1\\nқ.1\\nx+ 9 = 3 cos(y)\\x005z\\nƎ. cos(15)y+x\\n4=\\x001\\nƈƇ.2x+ 2y= 16In Exercises ƈƈ – ƈƋ, solve the system of linear equaࢢons.\\nƈƈ.x +y =\\x001\\n2x\\x00 3y= 8\\nƈƉ.2x\\x00 3y= 3\\n3x+ 6 y= 8\\nƈƊ.x\\x00y +z = 1\\n2x+ 6 y\\x00z =\\x004\\n4x\\x00 5y+ 2 z= 0\\nƈƋ.x +y\\x00z = 1\\n2x+y = 2\\ny+ 2 z= 0\\nƈƌ.Afarmerlooksouthiswindowathischickensandpigs.He\\ntellshisdaughterthatheseesҚƉheadsandƈƎƇlegs.How\\nmanychickensandpigsdoesthefarmerhave?\\nƈҚ.AladybuysƉƇtrinketsatayardsale.Thecostofeachtrin-\\nketiseitherŪƇ.ƊƇorŪƇ.Қƌ.IfshespendsŪқ.қƇ,howmany\\nofeachtypeoftrinketdoesshebuy?\\nƈƉƍ Note: when we multiplied the sec-\\nond equation by \\x001\\n2in our third step,\\nwe were proceeding according to a\\nwell-known algorithm (which we will\\nsoon explain) that is especially effi-\\ncient when implemented on a com-\\nputer.

This time we won’t\\nignore the zeros, but rather write them out.\\nb +g +r= 30\\n0b\\x00 2g+r= 0\\n\\x00b+g +r= 0,2\\n41 1 1 30\\n0\\x002 1 0\\n\\x001 1 1 03\\n5\\nNotice how even the equal signs are gone; we don’t need them, for we\\nknow that the last column contains the coefficients.\\nThe mathematical object we have created on the right is called a ma-\\ntrix . W e will give a formal mathematical definition in Chapter 5, where\\nwe will see that matrices are interesting objects in their own right, with\\nnumerous interesting properties and applications. F or now we can think of\\na matrix simply as a rectangular table of numbers that allows us to keep\\ntrack of certain information; namely , the constants that define our system\\nof linear equations. Note that each row in our matrix represents one of\\nthe equations, while each column (except for the last) represents a vari-\\nable. W e will often want to distinguish between the coefficient matrix\\nof a system; that is, the matrix containing the coefficients (the numbers\\nin front of the variables) of a system of linear equations, and the matrix\\nthat also includes the column of constants, as above. When we include\\nthe constants, we refer to the resulting matrix as an augmented matrix .\\nIt is common (but not mandatory) to place a vertical line separating\\nthe final column of an augmented matrix (containing the constants) from\\nƈƉƎ ChapterƋ SystemsofLinearEquaࢢons\\nthe other columns (containing the coefficients). One advantage of doing\\nso is that we can quickly recognize that we’re dealing with an augmented\\nmatrix rather than a coefficient matrix. F or example, the augmented\\nmatrix for the system (Ƌ.Қ)would be written as seen below on the right:\\n2\\n41 1 1 30\\n0\\x002 1 0\\n\\x001 1 1 03\\n52\\n41 1 1 30\\n0\\x002 1 0\\n\\x001 1 1 03\\n5\\nWithout the vertical line With the vertical line\\nT wo ways of writing an augmented matrix\\nW e can use augmented matrices to find solutions to linear equations\\nby using essentially the same steps we used above. Every time we used\\nthe word “equation” above, substitute the word “row,” as we show below.\\nThe comments explain how we get from the current set of equations (or\\nmatrix) to the one on the next line.\\nLet us look back at the steps we used to solve the system of equations\\nat the beginning of this section. Clearly , the order in which we right down\\nour equations does not affect the solution; in terms of our matrix, this\\nmeans we can rearrange the rows as we please. Note, however, that we\\ncannot rearrange the columns. T o do so would mix up our variables,\\ncausing us to lose track of our system.\\nIn addition to changing the order of our equations, we also saw that\\nwe can multiply both sides of any equation by a constant, and we can\\nadd a multiple of one equation to another. These three manipulations are\\nknown as the elementary operations used to solve a system of linear\\nequations. W e will see that with these three elementary operations, we\\ncan determine the solution (if any) to any linear system.\\nEach of these elementary operations corresponds to an operation per-\\nformed on the corresponding augmented matrix known as an elementary\\nrow operation . W e use a shorthand notation to describe these matrix\\noperations; let R1,R2represent “row 1” and “row 2,” respectively . W e\\ncan write “add row 1 to row 3, and replace row 3 with that sum” as\\n“R1+R3!R3. ” The expression “ R1$R2” means “interchange row 1\\nand row 2. ”\\nb +g +r= 30\\n\\x00 2g+r= 0\\n\\x00b+g +r= 02\\n41 1 1 30\\n0\\x002 1 0\\n\\x001 1 1 03\\n5\\nReplace equation 3 with the\\nsum of equations 1 and 3Replace row 3 with the sum\\nof rows 1 and 3.\\n(R1+R3!R3)\\nb+g +r= 30\\n\\x00 2g+r= 0\\n2g+ 2 r= 302\\n41 1 1 30\\n0\\x002 1 0\\n0 2 2 303\\n5\\nMultiply equation 2 by \\x001\\n2Multiply row 2 by \\x001\\n2\\n(\\x001\\n2R2!R2)\\nƈƊƇ Ƌ.Ɖ UsingMatricesToSolveSystemsofLinearEquaࢢons\\nb+g + r = 30\\ng +\\x001/2r= 0\\n2g+ 2 r = 302\\n41 1 1 30\\n0 1 \\x001\\n20\\n0 2 2 303\\n5\\nReplace equation 1 with the\\nsum of (\\x001) times equation 2\\nplus equation 1;\\nReplace equation 3 with the\\nsum of (\\x002) times equation 2\\nplus equation 3Replace row 1 with the sum\\nof(\\x001) times row 2 plus row\\n1 (\\x00R2+R1!R1);\\nReplace row 3 with the sum\\nof(\\x002) times row 2 plus row\\n3(\\x002R2+R3!R3)\\nb+ 3/2r= 30\\ng\\x00 1/2r= 0\\n3r = 302\\n641 03\\n230\\n0 1 \\x001\\n20\\n0 0 3 303\\n75\\nMultiply equation 3 by1\\n3Multiply row 3 by1\\n3\\n(1\\n3R3!R3)\\nb+ 3/2r= 30\\ng\\x00 1/2r= 0\\nr = 102\\n641 03\\n230\\n0 1 \\x001\\n20\\n0 0 1 103\\n75\\nReplace equation 2 with the\\nsum of1\\n2times equation 3\\nplus equation 2;\\nReplace equation 1 with the\\nsum of \\x003\\n2times equation 3\\nplus equation 1Replace row 2 with the sum\\nof1\\n2times row 3 plus row 2\\n(1\\n2R3+R2!R2);\\nReplace row 1 with the sum\\nof\\x003\\n2times row 3 plus row 1\\n(\\x003\\n2R3+R1!R1)\\nb = 15\\ng = 5\\nr= 102\\n641 0 0 15\\n0 1 0 5\\n0 0 1 103\\n75\\nThe final matrix contains the same solution information as we have on\\nthe left in the form of equations.

Elementary row operations\\ngive us a new linear system, but the solution to the new system is the\\nsame as the old. W e can use these operations as much as we want and not\\nchange the solution. This brings to mind two good questions:\\n1. Since we can use these operations as much as we want, how do we\\nknow when to stop? (Where are we supposed to “go” with these\\noperations?)\\n2. Is there an efficient way of using these operations? (How do we get\\n“there” the fastest?)\\nW e’ll answer the first question first. Most of the time (unless one\\nprefers obfuscation to clarification) we will want to take our original matrix\\nand, using the elementary row operations, put it into something called\\nreduced row echelon form . This is our “destination,” for this form\\nallows us to readily identify whether or not a solution exists, and in the\\ncase that it does, what that solution is.\\nIn the previous section, when we manipulated matrices to find solu-\\ntions, we were unwittingly putting the matrix into reduced row echelon\\nform. However, not all solutions come in such a simple manner as we’ve\\nseen so far. Putting a matrix into reduced row echelon form helps us iden-\\ntify all types of solutions. W e’ll explore the topic of understanding what\\nthe reduced row echelon form of a matrix tells us in the following sections;\\nin this section we focus on finding it.\\nDefinition 4.3.1 Reduced Row Echelon F orm\\nA matrix is in reduced row echelon form if its entries satisfy the\\nfollowing conditions.\\n1. The first nonzero entry in each row is a 1 (called a leading 1 ).\\n2. Each leading 1 comes in a column to the right of the leading\\n1s in rows above it.\\n3. All rows of all 0s come at the bottom of the matrix.\\n4. If a column contains a leading 1, then all other entries in that\\ncolumn are 0.\\nA matrix that satisfies the first three conditions is said to be in row\\nechelon form .\\nƈƊҚ Ƌ.Ɗ ElementaryRowOperaࢢonsandGaussianEliminaࢢon\\nExample Ƌ.Ɗ.ƈ Determining if a matrix is in reduced row eche-\\nlon form\\nWhich of the following matrices is in reduced row echelon form?\\na)[1 0\\n0 1]\\nb)[1 0 1\\n0 1 2]\\nc)[0 0\\n0 0]\\nd)[1 1 0\\n0 0 1]\\ne)2\\n41 0 0 1\\n0 0 0 0\\n0 0 1 33\\n5 f)2\\n41 2 0 0\\n0 0 3 0\\n0 0 0 43\\n5\\ng)2\\n40 1 2 3 0 4\\n0 0 0 0 1 5\\n0 0 0 0 0 03\\n5 h)2\\n41 1 0\\n0 1 0\\n0 0 13\\n5\\nSolution The matrices in a), b), c), d) and g) are all in reduced\\nrow echelon form. Check to see that each satisfies the necessary condi-\\ntions. If your instincts were wrong on some of these, correct your thinking\\naccordingly .\\nThe matrix in e) is not in reduced row echelon form since the row of all\\nzeros is not at the bottom. The matrix in f) is not in reduced row echelon\\nform since the first nonzero entries in rows 2 and 3 are not 1. Finally , the\\nmatrix in h) is not in reduced row echelon form since the first entry in\\ncolumn 2 is not zero; the second 1 in column 2 is a leading one, hence all\\nother entries in that column should be 0.\\nW e end this example with a preview of what we’ll learn in the future.\\nConsider the matrix in b). If this matrix came from the augmented matrix\\nof a system of linear equations, then we can readily recognize that the\\nsolution of the system is x1= 1 andx2= 2 . Again, in previous examples,\\nwhen we found the solution to a linear system, we were unwittingly putting\\nour matrices into reduced row echelon form.\\nW e began this section discussing how we can manipulate the entries\\nin a matrix with elementary row operations. This led to two questions,\\n“Where do we go?” and “How do we get there quickly?” W e’ve just\\nanswered the first question: most of the time we are “going to” reduced\\nrow echelon form. W e now address the second question.\\nThere is no one “right” way of using these operations to transform\\na matrix into reduced row echelon form. However, there is a general\\ntechnique that works very well in that it is very efficient (so we don’t waste\\ntime on unnecessary steps). This technique is called Gaussian elimination .\\nIt is named in honour of the great mathematician Karl F riedrich Gauss.\\nWhile this technique isn’t very difficult to use, it is one of those things\\nthat is easier understood by watching it being used than explained as a\\nseries of steps. With this in mind, we will go through one more example\\nhighlighting important steps and then we’ll explain the procedure in detail.\\nƈƊƍ T echnically , Gaussian elimination\\nconsists only of the “forward steps”;\\nincluding the “backwards steps” re-\\nsults in an algorithm known as Gauss-\\nJordan elimination . In Gaussian\\nelimination, instead of the backward\\nsteps, one uses back substitution .\\nAt the end of the forward steps, we\\ncan immediately read off x3= 3 from\\nthe third row. The second row corre-\\nsponds to the equation x2+ 2x3= 4 ,\\nand plugging in x3= 3 to this equa-\\ntion, we get x2+ 6 = 4 , sox2=\\x002.\\nFinally , the first row gives the equa-\\ntionx1+x2\\x003x3=\\x004, and plug-\\nging in x2=\\x002andx3= 3 , we get\\nx1\\x002\\x009 =\\x004, sox1= 7 . Us-\\ning back substitution is slightly more\\nefficient than including the backward\\nsteps, but once we get to examples\\nwith free parameters, you’ll probably\\nfind that it’s easier to go all the way\\nto reduced row-echelon form.ChapterƋ SystemsofLinearEquaࢢons\\nExample Ƌ.Ɗ.Ɖ Using row operations to simplify an augmented\\nmatrix\\nPut the augmented matrix of the following system of linear equations into\\nreduced row echelon form.\\n\\x003x1\\x00 3x2 + 9 x3= 12\\n2x1 + 2 x2\\x00 4x3=\\x002\\n\\x002x2\\x00 4x3=\\x008\\nSolution W e start by converting the linear system into an aug-\\nmented matrix.\\n2\\n4\\x003\\x003 9 12\\n2 2 \\x004\\x002\\n0\\x002\\x004\\x0083\\n5\\nOur next step is to change the entry in the box to a 1.

Starting from the right and working left, use Elementary Row Op-\\neration 1 repeatedly to put zeros above each leading 1.\\nƈƊƎ In Example 4.3.3 , we create our first\\nleading 1 by multiplying Row 1 by\\n\\x001\\n2. On a computer, this is the most\\nefficient option, and it’s a good choice\\nin this example, since every entry in\\nRow 1 is even, so no fractions are in-\\ntroduced. Most people like to avoid\\nfractions if they can, and in some\\ncases that’s impossible with this type\\nof row operation. The other option\\nwe could have tried here is adding\\nRow 3 to Row 1: since \\x002 + 3 = 1 ,\\nthe row operation R1!R1+R3also\\nwould have created a leading 1 for us.ChapterƋ SystemsofLinearEquaࢢons\\nThe basic method of Gaussian elimination is this: create leading ones\\nand then use elementary row operations to put zeros above and below\\nthese leading ones.

T/F: A particular solution for a linear system with infinite solutions\\ncan be found by arbitrarily picking values for the free variables.\\nSo far, whenever we have solved a system of linear equations, we have\\nalways found exactly one solution. This is not always the case; we will\\nfind in this section that some systems do not have a solution, and others\\nhave more than one.\\nW e start with a very simple example. Consider the following linear\\nsystem:\\nx\\x00y= 0:\\nThere are obviously infinite solutions to this system; as long as x=y, we\\nhave a solution. W e can picture all of these solutions by thinking of the\\ngraph of the equation y=xon the traditional x; y coordinate plane.\\nLet’s continue this visual aspect of considering solutions to linear sys-\\ntems. Consider the system\\nx+y= 2\\nx\\x00y= 0:\\nEach of these equations can be viewed as lines in the coordinate plane,\\nand since their slopes are different, we know they will intersect somewhere\\n(see Figure 4.1 (a)). In this example, they intersect at the point (1;1) –\\nthat is, when x= 1 andy= 1 , both equations are satisfied and we have\\na solution to our linear system. Since this is the only place the two lines\\nintersect, this is the only solution.\\nNow consider the linear system\\nx+y= 1\\n2x+ 2y= 2:\\nIt is clear that while we have two equations, they are essentially the same\\nequation; the second is just a multiple of the first. Therefore, when we\\ngraph the two equations, we are graphing the same line twice (see Figure\\n4.1 (b); the thicker line is used to represent drawing the line twice). In\\nthis case, we have an infinite solution set, just as if we only had the one\\nequation x+y= 1 . W e often write the solution as x= 1\\x00yto demonstrate\\nthatycan be any real number, and xis determined once we pick a value\\nfory.\\nƈƋƌ ChapterƋ SystemsofLinearEquaࢢons\\n(a) (b) (c)\\nFigure 4.1: The three possibilities for\\ntwo linear equations with two unknowns.\\nFinally , consider the linear system\\nx+y= 1\\nx+y= 2:\\nW e should immediately spot a problem with this system; if the sum of x\\nandyis 1, how can it also be 2? There is no solution to such a problem;\\nthis linear system has no solution. W e can visualize this situation in Figure\\n4.1 (c); the two lines are parallel and never intersect.\\nIf we were to consider a linear system with three equations and two\\nunknowns, we could visualize the solution by graphing the corresponding\\nthree lines. W e can picture that perhaps all three lines would meet at\\none point, giving exactly 1 solution; perhaps all three equations describe\\nthe same line, giving an infinite number of solutions; perhaps we have\\ndifferent lines, but they do not all meet at the same point, giving no\\nsolution. W e further visualize similar situations with, say , 20 equations\\nwith two variables.\\nOn the other hand, if we increase the number of variables to three,\\nthen we know from Section 3.6 that the correct geometric visualization of\\nthe situation involves planes. A single equation such as\\n2x\\x003y+ 4z= 7\\ndescribes a plane in R3with normal vector ⃗ n=2\\n42\\n\\x003\\n43\\n5. (By inspection,\\nwe can also choose a point on the plane. Since 3(\\x001) + 4(1) = 7 , we know\\nthat the point (0;\\x001;1) lies on the plane.)\\nIf we have two equations in three unknowns, three possibilities arise.\\nThe second equation could be a multiple of the first, in which case we\\nstill have our original plane. The second equation could also describe a\\nparallel plane; for example, we might have\\n2x\\x00 3y+ 4 z= 7\\n2x\\x00 3y+ 4 z= 3\\nIn this case we know that there is no possible solution to the system, since\\nthere can be no point in common to these two parallel planes. The last\\npossibility is that the planes are non-parallel, in which case they intersect\\nin a line.

The answer to this question lies with properly\\nunderstanding the reduced row echelon form of a matrix.

Rather, we\\nwill give the initial matrix, then immediately give the reduced row eche-\\nlon form of the matrix. W e trust that the reader can verify the accuracy\\nof this form by both performing the necessary steps by hand or utilizing\\nsome technology to do it for them.\\nƈƋƍ In other words, any free parameters\\nin our system can be regarded as in-\\ndependent variables; the remaining\\nvariables are then seen as dependent\\nvariables, and the equations deter-\\nmined by the reduced row echelon\\nform of our system tell us how the de-\\npendent variables depend on the pa-\\nrameters.ChapterƋ SystemsofLinearEquaࢢons\\nOur first example explores officially a quick example used in the intro-\\nduction of this section.\\nExample Ƌ.Ƌ.ƈ Solving a linear system\\nFind the solution to the linear system\\nx1+x2= 1\\n2x1+ 2 x2= 2:\\nSolution Create the corresponding augmented matrix, and then\\nput the matrix into reduced row echelon form.\\n[1 1 1\\n2 2 2]\\x00 !rref[1 1 1\\n0 0 0]\\nNow convert the reduced matrix back into equations.

T ry plugging these values back into the original\\nequations to verify that these indeed are solutions.

What exactly is a free variable? How do we recognize\\nwhich variables are free and which are not?\\nLook back to the reduced matrix in Example 4.4.1 . Notice that there\\nis only one leading 1 in that matrix, and that leading 1 corresponded to\\nthex1variable.

The first two rows give us the equations\\nx1+x3= 0\\nx2= 0:\\nSo far, so good. However the last row gives us the equation\\n0x1+ 0x2+ 0x3= 1\\nor, more concisely , 0 = 1 . Obviously , this is not true; we have reached a\\ncontradiction. Therefore, no solution exists; this system is inconsistent.\\nIn previous sections we have only encountered linear systems with\\nunique solutions (exactly one solution). Now we have seen three more\\nexamples with different solution types. The first two examples in this\\nsection had infinitely many solutions, and the third had no solution. How\\ncan we tell if a system is inconsistent?\\nA linear system will be inconsistent only when it implies that 0 equals\\n1. W e can tell if a linear system implies this by putting its corresponding\\naugmented matrix into reduced row echelon form. If we have any row\\nwhere all entries are 0 except for the entry in the last column, then the\\nsystem implies 0=1. More succinctly , if we have a leading 1 in the last\\ncolumn of an augmented matrix, then the linear system has no solution.\\nKey Idea 4.4.2 Inconsistent Systems of Linear Equa-\\ntions\\nA system of linear equations is inconsistent if the reduced row ech-\\nelon form of its corresponding augmented matrix has a leading 1\\nin the last column.\\nExample Ƌ.Ƌ.Ƌ V erifying that a system is inconsistent\\nConfirm that the linear system\\nx +y = 0\\n2x+ 2 y= 4\\nhas no solution.\\nƈƌƈ Why include the row of zeros in Ex-\\nample 4.4.5 ? Rows of zeros some-\\ntimes appear “unexpectedly” in ma-\\ntrices after they have been put in re-\\nduced row echelon form. When this\\nhappens, we do learn something ; it\\nmeans that at least one equation was\\na combination of some of the others.ChapterƋ SystemsofLinearEquaࢢons\\nSolution W e can verify that this system has no solution in two\\nways. First, let’s just think about it. If x+y= 0 , then it stands to\\nreason, by multiplying both sides of this equation by 2, that 2x+ 2y= 0 .\\nHowever, the second equation of our system says that 2x+ 2y= 4 . Since\\n0̸= 4 , we have a contradiction and hence our system has no solution. (W e\\ncannot possibly pick values for xandyso that 2x+ 2yequals both 0 and\\n4.)\\nNow let us confirm this using the prescribed technique from above.\\nThe reduced row echelon form of the corresponding augmented matrix is\\n[1 1 0\\n0 0 1]\\n:\\nW e have a leading 1 in the last column, so therefore the system is incon-\\nsistent.\\nLet’s summarize what we have learned up to this point. Consider the\\nreduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix of a system of linear\\nequations. (That sure seems like a mouthful in and of itself. However, it\\nboils down to “look at the reduced form of the usual matrix. ”) If there is\\na leading 1 in the last column, the system has no solution. Otherwise, if\\nthere is a leading 1 for each variable, then there is exactly one solution;\\notherwise (i.e., there are free variables) there are infinitely many solutions.\\nSystems with exactly one solution or no solution are the easiest to deal\\nwith; systems with infinitely many solutions are a bit harder to deal with.\\nTherefore, we’ll do a little more practice. First, a definition: if there are\\ninfinitely many solutions, what do we call one of those infinitely many\\nsolutions?\\nDefinition 4.4.3 Particular Solution\\nConsider a linear system of equations with infinitely many solu-\\ntions. A particular solution is one solution out of the infinitely\\nmany set of possible solutions.\\nThe easiest way to find a particular solution is to pick values for the\\nfree variables which then determines the values of the dependent variables.\\nAgain, more practice is called for.\\nExample Ƌ.Ƌ.ƌ Finding general and particular solutions\\nGive the general solution to a linear system whose augmented matrix in\\nreduced row echelon form is\\n2\\n41\\x001 0 2 4\\n0 0 1 \\x0037\\n0 0 0 0 03\\n5\\nand give two particular solutions.\\nSolution W e can essentially ignore the third row; it does not\\ndivulge any information about the solution. The first and second rows\\ncan be rewritten as the following equations:\\nx1\\x00x2+ 2x4= 4\\nx3\\x003x4= 7:\\nƈƌƉ Note: It’s useful to state the number\\nof parameters in the general solution\\nto a system with infinitely many solu-\\ntions, since the number of parameters\\nhas geometric significance.

Therefore x1andx3are dependent variables; all other\\nvariables (in this case, x2andx4) are free variables.\\nW e generally write our solution with the dependent variables on the\\nleft and independent variables and constants on the right. It is also a good\\npractice to acknowledge the fact that our free variables are, in fact, free.\\nSo our final solution would look something like\\nx1= 4 + s\\x002t\\nx2=sis free\\nx3= 7 + 3 t\\nx4=tis free :\\nNote that in this case we have two free variables, x2andx4, so we introduce\\ntwo parameters, sandt, in our general solution. While we would be correct\\nin saying that this system has infinitely many solutions, we can be more\\nprecise about the nature of those solutions. Here, we say that we have\\natwo-parameter family of solutions , to indicate the fact that two\\ndifferent parameters are required to describe the most general solution.\\nT o find particular solutions, choose values for our free variables. There\\nis no “right” way of doing this; we are “free” to choose whatever we wish.\\nBy setting x2= 0 = x4, we have the solution x1= 4 ,x2= 0 ,x3= 7 ,\\nx4= 0 . By setting x2= 1 andx4=\\x005, we have the solution x1= 15 ,\\nx2= 1 ,x3=\\x008,x4=\\x005. It is easier to read this when are variables are\\nlisted vertically , so we repeat these solutions:\\nOne particular solution is:\\nx1= 4\\nx2= 0\\nx3= 7\\nx4= 0:Another particular solution\\nis:\\nx1= 15\\nx2= 1\\nx3=\\x008\\nx4=\\x005:\\nExample Ƌ.Ƌ.Қ Finding general and particular solutions\\nFind the solution to a linear system whose augmented matrix in reduced\\nrow echelon form is[1 0 0 2 3\\n0 1 0 4 5]\\nand give two particular solutions.\\nSolution Converting the two rows into equations we have\\nx1+ 2x4= 3\\nx2+ 4x4= 5:\\nW e see that x1andx2are our dependent variables, for they correspond\\nto the leading 1s. Therefore, x3andx4are independent variables. This\\nsituation feels a little unusual, for x3doesn’t appear in any of the equations\\nabove, but cannot overlook it; it is still a free variable since there is not a\\nƈƌƊ What kind of situation would lead to\\na column of all zeros?

In\\npractical terms, we could respond by\\nremoving the corresponding column\\nfrom the matrix and just keep in mind\\nthat that variable is free.

By picking two\\nvalues for x3, we get two particular solutions.\\nOne particular solution is:\\nx1= 4\\nx2= 1\\nx3= 0:Another particular solution\\nis:\\nx1= 3\\nx2= 1\\nx3= 1:\\nƈƌƋ Ƌ.Ƌ ExistenceandUniquenessofSoluࢢons\\nThe constants and coefficients of a matrix work together to determine\\nwhether a given system of linear equations has one, infinitely many , or no\\nsolution. The concept will be fleshed out more in later chapters, but in\\nshort, the coefficients determine whether a matrix will have exactly one\\nsolution or not. In the “or not” case, the constants determine whether or\\nnot infinitely many solutions or no solution exists. (So if a given linear\\nsystem has exactly one solution, it will always have exactly one solution\\neven if the constants are changed.)

Why do we need two points to find the equation of the\\nline? Because in the equation of the a line, we have two unknowns, and\\nhence we’ll need two equations to find values for these unknowns.\\nA quadratic has three unknowns (the coefficients of the x2term and\\nthexterm, and the constant). Therefore we’ll need three equations, and\\ntherefore we’ll need three points.\\nWhat happens if we try to find the quadratic function that goes through\\n3 points that are all on the same line? The fast answer is that you’ll get\\nthe equation of a line; there isn’t a quadratic function that goes through\\n3 colinear points. T ry it and see! (Pick easy points, like (0;0),(1;1) and\\n(2;2). Y ou’ll find that the coefficient of the x2term is 0.)\\nOf course, we can do the same type of thing to find polynomials that\\ngo through 4, 5, etc., points. In general, if you are given n+ 1 points, a\\npolynomial that goes through all n+ 1 points will have degree at most n.\\nExample Ƌ.ƌ.ƌ A money counting problem\\nA woman has 32 $1, $5 and $10 bills in her purse, giving her a total of\\n$100. How many bills of each denomination does she have?\\nSolution Let’s name our unknowns x,yandzfor our ones, fives\\nand tens, respectively (it is tempting to call them o,fandt, but olooks\\ntoo much like 0). W e know that there are a total of 32 bills, so we have\\nthe equation\\nx+y+z= 32:\\nW e also know that we have $100, so we have the equation\\nx+ 5y+ 10z= 100 :\\nW e have three unknowns but only two equations, so we know that we\\ncannot expect a unique solution. Let’s try to solve this system anyway\\nand see what we get.\\nPutting the system into a matrix and then finding the reduced row\\nechelon form, we have\\n[\\n1 1 1 32\\n1 5 10 100]\\n\\x00 !rref[\\n1 0 \\x005\\n415\\n0 19\\n417]\\n:\\nReading from our reduced matrix, we have the infinite solution set\\nx= 15 +5\\n4z\\ny= 17\\x009\\n4z\\nzis free.\\nWhile we do have infinite solutions, most of these solutions really don’t\\nmake sense in the context of this problem. (Setting z=1\\n2doesn’t make\\nsense, for having half a ten dollar bill doesn’t give us $5. Likewise, having\\nz= 8 doesn’t make sense, for then we’d have “ \\x001” $5 bills.) So we must\\nmake sure that our choice of zdoesn’t give us fractions of bills or negative\\namounts of bills.\\nƈҚƉ Ƌ.ƌ ApplicaࢢonsofLinearSystems\\nT o avoid fractions, zmust be a multiple of 4 ( \\x004;0;4;8; : : : ). Of course,\\nz\\x150for a negative number wouldn’t make sense. If z= 0 , then we have\\n15 one dollar bills and 17 five dollar bills, giving us $100. If z= 4 , then\\nwe have x= 20 andy= 8 . W e already mentioned that z= 8 doesn’t\\nmake sense, nor does any value of zwhere z\\x158.\\nSo it seems that we have two answers; one with z= 0 and one with\\nz= 4 . Of course, by the statement of the problem, we are led to believe\\nthat the lady has at least one $10 bill, so probably the “best” answer is\\nthat we have 20 $1 bills, 8 $5 bills and 4 $10 bills. The real point of this\\nexample, though, is to address how infinite solutions may appear in a real\\nworld situation, and how surprising things may result.\\nExample Ƌ.ƌ.Қ Recreating a football score\\nIn a football game, teams can score points through touchdowns worth 6\\npoints, extra points (that follow touchdowns) worth 1 point, two point\\nconversions (that also follow touchdowns) worth 2 points and field goals,\\nworth 3 points. Y ou are told that in a football game, the two compet-\\ning teams scored on 7 occasions, giving a total score of 24 points. Each\\ntouchdown was followed by either a successful extra point or two point\\nconversion. In what ways were these points scored?\\nSolution The question asks how the points were scored; we can\\ninterpret this as asking how many touchdowns, extra points, two point\\nconversions and field goals were scored. W e’ll need to assign variable\\nnames to our unknowns; let trepresent the number of touchdowns scored;\\nletxrepresent the number of e xtra points scored, let w represent the\\nnumber of t wo point conversions, and let frepresent the number of field\\ngoals scored.\\nNow we address the issue of writing equations with these variables\\nusing the given information. Since we have a total of 7 scoring occasions,\\nwe know that\\nt+x+w+f= 7:\\nThe total points scored is 24; considering the value of each type of scoring\\nopportunity , we can write the equation\\n6t+x+ 2w+ 3f= 24:\\nFinally , we know that each touchdown was followed by a successful extra\\npoint or two point conversion. This is subtle, but it tells us that the\\nnumber of touchdowns is equal to the sum of extra points and two point\\nconversions. In other words,\\nt=x+w:\\nT o solve our problem, we put these equations into a matrix and put\\nthe matrix into reduced row echelon form. Doing so, we find\\n2\\n41 1 1 1 7\\n6 1 2 3 24\\n1\\x001\\x001 0 03\\n5\\x00 !rref2\\n41 0 0 0 :5 3:5\\n0 1 0 1 4\\n0 0 1 \\x000:5\\x000:53\\n5:\\nTherefore, we know that\\nt= 3:5\\x000:5f\\nx= 4\\x00f\\nw=\\x000:5 + 0:5f:\\nƈҚƊ ChapterƋ SystemsofLinearEquaࢢons\\nW e recognize that this means there are “infinite solutions,” but of course\\nmost of these will not make sense in the context of a real football game.\\nW e must apply some logic to make sense of the situation.\\nProgressing in no particular order, consider the second equation, x=\\n4\\x00f. In order for us to have a positive number of extra points, we must\\nhave f\\x144. (And of course, we need f\\x150, too.) Therefore, right away\\nwe know we have a total of only 5 possibilities, where f= 0 ,1,2,3or4.\\nF rom the first and third equations, we see that if fis an even number,\\nthen tandw will both be fractions (for instance, if f= 0 , then t=\\n3:5) which does not make sense. Therefore, we are down to two possible\\nsolutions, f= 1 andf= 3 .\\nIff= 1 , we have 3 touchdowns, 3 extra points, no two point con-\\nversions, and (of course), 1 field goal. (Check to make sure that gives\\n24 points!) If f= 3 , then we 2 touchdowns, 1 extra point, 1 two point\\nconversion, and (of course) 3 field goals. Again, check to make sure this\\ngives us 24 points. Also, we should check each solution to make sure that\\nwe have a total of 7 scoring occasions and that each touchdown could be\\nfollowed by an extra point or a two point conversion.\\nW e have seen a variety of applications of systems of linear equations.\\nW e would do well to remind ourselves of the ways in which solutions to\\nlinear systems come: there can be exactly one solution, infinite solutions,\\nor no solutions. While we did see a few examples where it seemed like we\\nhad only 2 solutions, this was because we were restricting our solutions to\\n“make sense” within a certain context.\\nW e should also remind ourselves that linear equations are immensely\\nimportant. The examples we considered here ask fundamentally simple\\nquestions like “How fast is the water moving?” or “What is the quadratic\\nfunction that goes through these three points?” or “How were points in\\na football game scored?” The real “important” situations ask much more\\ndifficult questions that often require thousands of equations! (Gauss began\\nthe systematic study of solving systems of linear equations while trying to\\npredict the next sighting of a comet; he needed to solve a system of linear\\nequations that had 17 unknowns. T oday , this a relatively easy situation\\nto handle with the help of computers, but to do it by hand is a real pain.)\\nOnce we understand the fundamentals of solving systems of equations, we\\ncan move on to looking at solving bigger systems of equations; this text\\nfocuses on getting us to understand the fundamentals.\\nSpan and linear independence\\nW e mentioned in Section 3.7 that the techniques of this chapter were\\nnecessary to answer questions about vectors, including those involving\\nspan and linear independence.

This is because the row operations\\nin an augmented matrix [Aj⃗b]are dictated by the matrix A, and not by\\nthe vector ⃗b. With this observation in place, we can speed things up\\nconsiderably by solving the problem for all three vectors at once.

Some of the applied examples we considered\\nin the previous section led naturally to systems of equations, and had solu-\\ntions that were best interpreted in that context. Other examples, such as\\nthose involving span and linear independence, were stated in terms of vec-\\ntors. In this section, we discuss how to write a system of linear equations\\nin terms of vectors and matrices, and express solutions as vectors.\\nExpressing the solutions of linear systems in terms of vectors will give\\nus additional insight into the behaviour of those systems, and provides a\\nstepping-off point for the study of the algebra of matrices.\\nW e have often relied on previous algebra experience to help us un-\\nderstand linear algebra concepts. W e do that again here. Consider the\\nequation ax=b, where a= 3 andb= 6 . If we asked one to “solve for\\nx,” what exactly would we be asking? W e would want to find a number,\\nwhich we call x, where atimes xgives b; in this case, it is a number,\\nwhen multiplied by 3, returns 6. As long as a̸= 0 (what if adoes equal\\nzero?), we know that we can multiply both sides of the equation by1\\nato\\ngetx=1\\na(b) =b\\na.\\nConsider a general system of linear equations, of the form\\na11x1+a12x2+\\x01\\x01\\x01+a1nxn=b1\\na21x1+a22x2+\\x01\\x01\\x01+a2nxn=b2\\n............\\nam1x1+am2x2+\\x01\\x01\\x01+amnxn=bm(Ƌ.ƍ)\\nNotice that the information we place into our augmented matrix can be\\ndivided into two pieces: the coefficient matrix\\nA=2\\n6664a11a12\\x01\\x01\\x01 a1n\\na21a22\\x01\\x01\\x01 a2n\\n............\\nam1am2\\x01\\x01\\x01amn3\\n7775\\nand the column vector\\n⃗b=2\\n6664b1\\nb2\\n...\\nbm3\\n7775:\\nƈƍƈ ChapterƋ SystemsofLinearEquaࢢons\\nMoreover, instead of writing our solution as a list ( x1=; x2=: : : ), we can\\narrange our variables into a vector\\n⃗ x=2\\n6664x1\\nx2\\n...\\nxn3\\n7775;\\nand express our solution as a single vector rather than a list of numbers.\\nT o create an analogy with the single variable equation ax=b, we ask:\\nIs there a way to define the product A⃗ x of a matrix and a column vector\\nin such a way that the system (Ƌ.ƍ)can be written in the form\\nA⃗ x=⃗b?\\nF ortunately for us, the answer is yes! Even better, we’ll see that the defini-\\ntion we give here turns out to be a special case (and motivating example)\\nfor the general definition of matrix multiplication given in Section 5.2 .\\nThe definition of the product A⃗ x is straightforward. W e want the\\nresult to be a column vector of size m (that is, with m entries), so that we\\ncan set it equal to the column vector ⃗b. F urthermore, each entry in ⃗bis\\nthe right-hand side of an equation in (Ƌ.ƍ), so we want the corresponding\\nentry in A⃗ x to be the left-hand side.

First, note that\\nthe number of columns in the matrix A matches the number of entries in\\nthe vector ⃗ x, and the number of rows in A matches the number of entries\\nin the vector ⃗b. Moreover,\\nTheithentry in the vector A⃗ x is obtained by forming the dot\\nproduct of row iin the matrix A (viewed as a vector in Rn)\\nwith the vector ⃗ x.\\nThat is, since each row of A hasnentries, as does the vector ⃗ x, we\\ncan form the dot product of ⃗ xwith any of the rows of A. Each such dot\\nproduct forms the corresponding entry in the vector A⃗ x .\\nƈƍƉ Ƌ.Қ VectorSoluࢢonstoLinearSystems\\nT o help understand what this is asking, we’ll consider an example.

Let’s “solve for ⃗ x,” given the equation A⃗ x=⃗b.\\nW e multiply out the left hand side of this equation according to Defi-\\nnition 4.6.1 . The first row of Ais the row vector ⃗ a1=[1 1 1]\\n.

Given\\nthe matrix-vector equation A⃗ x=⃗b, we can recognize A as the coefficient\\nmatrix from a linear system and ⃗bas the vector of the constants from the\\nlinear system. Given a system of equations, rewriting it in matrix form is\\nequally straightforward.\\nT o solve a matrix–vector equation (and the corresponding linear sys-\\ntem), we simply augment the matrix A with the vector ⃗b, put this matrix\\ninto reduced row echelon form, and interpret the results.\\nW e convert the above linear system into an augmented matrix and find\\nthe reduced row echelon form:\\n2\\n41 1 1 2\\n1\\x001 2 \\x003\\n2 0 1 13\\n5\\x00 !rref2\\n41 0 0 1\\n0 1 0 2\\n0 0 1 \\x0013\\n5:\\nThis tells us that x1= 1 ,x2= 2 andx3=\\x001, so\\n⃗ x=2\\n41\\n2\\n\\x0013\\n5:\\nƈƍƊ ChapterƋ SystemsofLinearEquaࢢons\\nW e should check our work; multiply out A⃗ x and verify that we indeed\\nget⃗b:2\\n41 1 1\\n1\\x001 2\\n2 0 13\\n52\\n41\\n2\\n\\x0013\\n5 does equal2\\n42\\n\\x003\\n13\\n5:\\nExample Ƌ.Қ.ƈ Solving a matrix equation\\nSolve the equation A⃗ x=⃗bfor⃗ xwhere\\nA=2\\n41 2 3\\n\\x001 2 1\\n1 1 03\\n5 and2\\n45\\n\\x001\\n23\\n5:\\nSolution The solution is rather straightforward, even though we\\ndid a lot of work before to find the answer.

While asking one to solve the\\nequation A⃗ x=⃗bfor⃗ xseems like a new problem, in reality it is just asking\\nthat we solve a system of linear equations. Our variables x1, etc., appear\\nnot individually but as the entries of our vector ⃗ x. W e are simply writing\\nan old problem in a new way .\\nIn line with this new way of writing the problem, we have a new way\\nof writing the solution. Instead of listing, individually , the values of the\\nunknowns, we simply list them as the elements of our vector ⃗ x.\\nThese are important ideas, so we state the basic principle once more:\\nsolving the equation A⃗ x =⃗bfor⃗ xis the same thing as solving a linear\\nsystem of equations. Equivalently , any system of linear equations can be\\nwritten in the form A⃗ x=⃗bfor some matrix A and vector ⃗b.\\nSince these ideas are equivalent, we’ll refer to A⃗ x=⃗bboth as a matrix–\\nvector equation and as a system of linear equations: they are the same\\nthing.\\nW e’ve seen two examples illustrating this idea so far, and in both cases\\nthe linear system had exactly one solution. W e know from Theorem 4.4.1\\nthat any linear system has either one solution, infinitely many solutions,\\nor no solution. So how does our new method of writing a solution work\\nwith infinitely many solutions and no solutions?\\nCertainly , if A⃗ x =⃗bhas no solution, we simply say that the linear\\nsystem has no solution. There isn’t anything special to write. So the\\nonly other option to consider is the case where we have infinitely many\\nsolutions. W e’ll learn how to handle these situations through examples.\\nƈƍƋ Note: Our convention is always that\\n⃗0denotes the vector of the appropri-\\nate size whose entries are all zero, so\\nwe didn’t really need to specify that\\n⃗Ɔ=[0\\n0]\\n;but we did just to elimi-\\nnate any uncertainty .Ƌ.Қ VectorSoluࢢonstoLinearSystems\\nExample Ƌ.Қ.Ɖ Finding the vector solution to a linear system\\nSolve the linear system A⃗ x =⃗Ɔfor⃗ x and write the solution in vector\\nform, where\\nA=[1 2\\n2 4]\\nand ⃗Ɔ=[\\n0\\n0]\\n:\\nSolution\\nT o solve this system, put the augmented matrix into reduced row ech-\\nelon form, which we do below.\\n[\\n1 2 0\\n2 4 0]\\x00 !rref[\\n1 2 0\\n0 0 0]\\nW e interpret the reduced row echelon form of this matrix to write the\\nsolution as\\nx1=\\x002t\\nx2=tis free.\\nW e are not done; we need to write the solution in vector form, for our\\nsolution is the vector ⃗ x.

First, matrix equations (or the cor-\\nresponding system of linear equations) such as the above where the vector\\non the right-hand side is the zero vector form a special case that is im-\\nportant enough to have its own name: these are known as homogeneous\\nsystems of equations.

This is an important characteristic of homoge-\\nneous systems: since A⃗0 =⃗0for any matrix A, we always have (at least)\\nthe solution ⃗ x=⃗0.

On the other hand, every solution to\\nthe system A⃗ x=⃗bcan be obtained by adding the vector ⃗ xpto an element\\nof the set of solutions to the homogeneous system A⃗ x=⃗0. W e’ll elaborate\\non this shortly .\\nThe previous examples illustrate some important concepts. One is that\\n(at least, when ⃗ x2R2orR3) we can visualize the solution to a system of\\nlinear equations. Before, when we had infinitely many solutions, we knew\\nƈƍƎ Note: Visually , the solutions in Ex-\\namples 4.6.2 and 4.6.5 were both\\nlines; from our experience with Sec-\\ntion 3.5 we know that this makes\\nsense, since the solutions involved a\\nsingle parameter t. The reader can\\nsimilarly expect that a solution in-\\nvolving two parameters can be visual-\\nized as a plane. Such was the case in\\nExample 4.6.4 , except that here, our\\nsolution is a plane in R4, making it\\nsomewhat harder to visualize.ChapterƋ SystemsofLinearEquaࢢons\\nwe could arbitrarily pick values for our free variables and get different\\nsolutions. W e knew this to be true, and we even practised it, but the\\nresult was not very “tangible. ” Now, we can view our solution as a vector;\\nby picking different values for our free variables, we see this as multiplying\\ncertain important vectors by a scalar which gives a different solution.\\nAnother important concept that these examples demonstrate comes\\nfrom the fact that Examples 4.6.2 and 4.6.5 were only “slightly different”\\nand hence had only “slightly different” answers. Both solutions had\\nt[\\n\\x002\\n1]\\nin them; in Example 4.6.5 the solution also had another vector added to\\nthis. The addition of the vector ⃗ xpin Example 4.6.5 is needed to account\\nfor the fact that we were dealing with a non-homogeneous system of linear\\nequations.\\nRecall that for a homogeneous system of linear equations, we know that\\n⃗ x=⃗0will be a solution, since no matter what the matrix A is, we can\\nbe certain that A⃗Ɔ=⃗Ɔ. This fact is important; the zero vector is always\\na solution to a homogeneous linear system. Therefore a homogeneous\\nsystem is always consistent; we need only to determine whether we have\\nexactly one solution (just ⃗Ɔ) or infinitely many solutions. This idea is\\nimportant, so we give it its own box.\\nKey Idea 4.6.1 Homogeneous Systems and Consistency\\nAll homogeneous linear systems are consistent.\\nHow do we determine if we have exactly one or infinitely many solu-\\ntions? Recall Key Idea 4.4.1 : if the solution has any free variables, then\\nit will have infinitely many solutions. How can we tell if the system has\\nfree variables? F orm the augmented matrix[\\nA⃗Ɔ]\\n, put it into reduced\\nrow echelon form, and interpret the result.\\nIt may seem that we’ve brought up a new question, “When does A⃗ x=\\n⃗Ɔhave exactly one or infinitely many solutions?” only to answer with\\n“Look at the reduced row echelon form of Aand interpret the results, just\\nas always. ” Why bring up a new question if the answer is an old one?\\nWhile the new question has an old solution, it does lead to a great\\nidea. Let’s refresh our memory; earlier we solved two linear systems,\\nA⃗ x=⃗Ɔ and A⃗ x=⃗b\\nwhere\\nA=[1 2\\n2 4]\\nand ⃗b=[3\\n6]\\n:\\nThe solution to the first system of equations, A⃗ x=⃗Ɔ, is\\n⃗ x=t[\\x002\\n1]\\n=t⃗ v\\nand the solution to the second set of equations, A⃗ x=⃗b, is\\n⃗ x=[3\\n0]\\n+t[\\x002\\n1]\\n=⃗ xp+t⃗ v;\\nƈқƇ Ƌ.Қ VectorSoluࢢonstoLinearSystems\\nfor all t2R, where ⃗ xp=[3\\n0]\\nand⃗ v=[\\n\\x002\\n1]\\n.\\nT o see why the general solution to A⃗ x=⃗bworks, note that\\nA⃗ xp=[1 2\\n2 4][3\\n0]\\n=[3\\n6]\\n=⃗b;\\nso⃗ xpis a solution. (The subscript pof “⃗ xp” is used to denote that this\\nvector is a particular solution: see Definition 4.4.3 .) What about the\\ngeneral solution ⃗ x=⃗ xp+t⃗ v? Recalling that A⃗ v=⃗Ɔ, we have\\nA⃗ x=A(⃗ xp+t⃗ v) =A⃗ xp+t(A⃗ v)\\n=⃗b+t(⃗0) =⃗b;\\nfor any value of t, so there are infinitely many solutions to our system, one\\nfor each t2R. The whole point is that ⃗ xpitself is a solution to A⃗ x=⃗b,\\nand we could find more solutions by adding vectors “that go to zero” when\\nmultiplied by A.\\nSo we wonder: does this mean that A⃗ x=⃗bwill have infinitely many\\nsolutions? After all, if ⃗ xpand⃗ xp+⃗ vare both solutions, don’t we have\\ninfinitely many solutions?\\nNo. If A⃗ x=⃗Ɔhas exactly one solution, then ⃗ v=⃗Ɔ, and ⃗ xp=⃗ xp+⃗ v;\\nwe only have one solution.\\nSo here is the culmination of all of our fun that started a few pages\\nback. If ⃗ vis a solution to A⃗ x=⃗Ɔand⃗ xpis a solution to A⃗ x=⃗b, then\\n⃗ xp+⃗ vis also a solution to A⃗ x=⃗b. IfA⃗ x=⃗Ɔhas infinitely many solutions,\\nso does A⃗ x=⃗b; ifA⃗ x=⃗Ɔhas only one solution, so does A⃗ x=⃗b. This\\nculminating idea is of course important enough to be stated again.\\nKey Idea 4.6.2 Solutions of Consistent Systems\\nLetA⃗ x=⃗bbe a consistent system of linear equations.\\n1. IfA⃗ x=⃗Ɔhas exactly one solution (⃗ x=⃗Ɔ), then A⃗ x=⃗bhas\\nexactly one solution.\\n2. IfA⃗ x =⃗Ɔhas infinitely many solutions, then A⃗ x =⃗bhas\\ninfinitely many solutions.\\nA key word in the above statement is consistent . IfA⃗ x=⃗bis inconsis-\\ntent (the linear system has no solution), then it doesn’t matter how many\\nsolutions A⃗ x=⃗Ɔhas;A⃗ x=⃗bhas no solution.\\nW e can elaborate on Key Idea 4.6.2 above, as well as Key Idea 4.4.1\\nfrom Section 4.4 by introducing one more piece of important terminology .\\nBy now it is probably clear that the leading 1s in the reduced row echelon\\nform of a matrix play a key role in understanding the system. In fact, it\\nturns out that we can describe all of the different possibilities for a linear\\nsystem in terms of one number: the number of leading 1s in the reduced\\nrow echelon form of a matrix.\\nƈқƈ ChapterƋ SystemsofLinearEquaࢢons\\nDefinition 4.6.4 The rank of a matrix\\nThe rank of a matrix A is denoted by rank (A)and defined as the\\nnumber of leading 1s in the reduced row echelon form of A.\\nAlthough we do not prove it in this textbook, the reduced row echelon\\nform of any matrix is unique ; it follows from this fact that the rank of a\\nmatrix is a well-defined number. The importance of rank is outlined in\\nthe following result.\\nTheorem 4.6.1 Rank and solution types\\nLetA be an m\\x02nmatrix. F or any linear system A⃗ x =⃗binn\\nvariables, we have the following possibilities:\\n1. If rank (A)< rank[\\nA⃗b]\\n, then the system A⃗ x=⃗bis incon-\\nsistent.\\n2. If rank (A) = rank[\\nA⃗b]\\n=n(where nis the number of\\nvariables), then the system A⃗ x=⃗bhas a unique solution.\\n3. If rank (A) = rank[\\nA⃗b]\\n=< n , then the system A⃗ x=⃗bhas\\ninfinitely solutions. Moreover, the general solution to A⃗ x=⃗b\\nwill involve kparameters, where\\nk=n\\x00rank (A):\\nT o understand Item 1 above, note that if\\nrank (A)< rank[\\nA⃗b]\\n;\\nthen there must be a leading 1 in the right-hand column of the reduced\\nrow echelon form of[\\nA⃗b]\\n, meaning that we have a row of the form\\n[0 0 \\x01\\x01\\x01 01]\\n;\\nwhich is exactly what we expect in a system with no solutions.\\nItems 2 and 3 in Theorem 4.6.1 simply give another way of stating the\\nfact that the free variables are those variables that do not have a leading 1\\nin their column. This seems like an obvious fact, but it is very important.\\nIndeed, this observation leads to a major theorem, sometimes known as\\nthe F undamental Theorem of Linear T ransformations, or the Rank-Nullity\\nTheorem.\\nLet us explore this result with a series of examples.\\nƈқƉ Ƌ.Қ VectorSoluࢢonstoLinearSystems\\nExample Ƌ.Қ.Қ Using matrices and vectors to solve a system of\\nequations\\nRewrite the linear system\\nx1+ 2 x2\\x00 3x3+ 2 x4+ 7 x5= 2\\n3x1+ 4 x2+ 5 x3+ 2 x4+ 3 x5=\\x004\\nas a matrix–vector equation, solve the system using vector notation, and\\ngive the solution to the related homogeneous equations.\\nSolution Rewriting the linear system in the form of A⃗ x=⃗b, we\\nhave that\\nA=[1 2 \\x003 2 7\\n3 4 5 2 3]\\n; ⃗ x =2\\n66664x1\\nx2\\nx3\\nx4\\nx53\\n77775and ⃗b=[2\\n\\x004]\\n:\\nT o solve the system, we put the associated augmented matrix into reduced\\nrow echelon form and interpret the results.\\n[1 2 \\x003 2 7 2\\n3 4 5 2 3 \\x004]\\x00 !rref[1 0 11 \\x002\\x0011\\x008\\n0 1 \\x007 2 9 5]\\nx1=\\x008\\x0011r+ 2s+ 11t\\nx2= 5 + 7 r\\x002s\\x009t\\nx3=ris free\\nx4=sis free\\nx5=tis free\\nW e use this information to write ⃗ x, again pulling it apart.

But if A⃗ x=⃗bis not consistent, it does not matter how\\nmany solutions A⃗ x=⃗Ɔhas;A⃗ x=⃗bis still inconsistent.\\nIn this chapter, we developed a systematic method for solving systems\\nof linear equations. A key tool in this method was the augmented matrix\\ncorresponding to a given system. In this final section, we’ve seen that\\nfurther insight into the structure of solutions can be gained by considering\\nour systems in terms of matrices and vectors.\\nIn the next chapter, we will begin the study of matrices as objects unto\\nthemselves. W e will see that they can be added and multiplied by scalars\\nin exactly the same way as vectors, and in addition to this, matrices of the\\ncorrect sizes can be multiplied in a way that reproduces Definition 4.6.1\\nabove as a special case.\\nOne question that may have occurred to you as you worked through\\nthis section is the following: in the one-variable linear equation ax=b,\\nwe know that as long as a̸= 0 , we can divide both sides by a, giving us\\nthe solution x=b/a. Now, given the matrix equation A⃗ x=⃗b, is there\\nsome equivalent means of “dividing by A” to obtain the solution ⃗ x? The\\nshort answer is no. Indeed, there is no such thing as matrix division; the\\nalgebraic rules for matrix multiplication are much more complicated than\\nthey are for numbers. (In particular, we’ll see that for matrices, AB is\\nusually not the same thing as BA !)\\nThe slightly longer answer to our question might be phrased as “Some-\\ntimes.

A matrix with m rows and ncolumns is\\nsaid to be an m\\x02nmatrix (“an m bynmatrix”, or a matrix of\\nsizem\\x02n).\\nThe entries of an m\\x02nmatrix are indexed as follows:\\n2\\n666664a11a12a13\\x01\\x01\\x01 a1n\\na21a22a23\\x01\\x01\\x01 a2n\\na31a32a33\\x01\\x01\\x01 a3n\\n...............\\nam1am2am3\\x01\\x01\\x01amn3\\n777775:\\nThat is, a32 means “the number in the third row and second col-\\numn. ” T o save space, we will sometimes use the shorthand notation\\nA= [aij]to denote a matrix Awith entries aij. If we need to spec-\\nify the size, we can also write A= [aij]m\\x02n.\\nT wo special types of matrix are worth noting: those with a single row\\nor column. Such matrices are known as vectors .\\nƈƎƇ ƌ.ƈ MatrixAddiࢢonandScalarMulࢢplicaࢢon\\nDefinition 5.1.2 Row and column vectors\\nA row vector is a 1\\x02nmatrix of the form\\nR=[\\nr1r2\\x01\\x01\\x01rn]\\n:\\nA column vector is am\\x021matrix of the form\\nC=2\\n6664c1\\nc2\\n...\\ncm3\\n7775:\\nIn particular, we can obtain row or column vectors by isolating any\\nrow or column of a given m\\x02nmatrix.

If we arrange these totals into a matrix T, it seems like it should\\nbe reasonable to define matrix addition in such a way that we can write\\nT=A+B:\\nThis leads to two questions. First, how do we define matrix addition in\\norder to ensure this outcome? Second, and perhaps more fundamentally ,\\nwhat do we mean by “ =” in the context of matrices? Let us tackle the\\nsecond question first.\\nDefinition 5.1.3 Matrix Equality\\nT wo m\\x02n matrices A andB are equal if their corresponding\\nentries are equal.\\nNotice that our more formal definition specifies that if matrices are\\nequal, they have the same size. This should make sense.\\nNow we move on to describing how to add two matrices together. T o\\nstart off, take a wild stab: how do you think we should add our matrices\\nƈƎƈ Chapterƌ MatrixAlgebra\\nof crop data above? W ell, if we want the sum to represent the total yields\\nfor each crop, then it stands to reason that to add the two matrices, we\\nadd together each of the corresponding crop yields within them:\\nT=A+B\\n=2\\n448 18 92 0\\n0 0 73 152\\n34 203 0 883\\n5+2\\n441 25 15 20\\n0 72 0 165\\n47 193 0 773\\n5\\n=2\\n448 + 41 18 + 25 92 + 15 0 + 20\\n0 + 0 0 + 72 73 + 0 152 + 165\\n34 + 47 203 + 193 0 + 0 88 + 773\\n5\\n=2\\n489 43 107 20\\n0 72 73 317\\n81 396 0 1653\\n5:\\nSo to add the two matrices, we added their corresponding entries. This\\nis exactly how we define matrix addition in general:\\nDefinition 5.1.4 Matrix Addition\\nLetA= [aij]andB= [bij]bem\\x02nmatrices.

This would be obtained by simply calculating\\nthe total for each row in the matrix A. Another way to accomplish the\\nsame task is as follows: let\\nC1=2\\n448\\n0\\n343\\n5; C2=2\\n418\\n0\\n2033\\n5; C3=2\\n492\\n73\\n03\\n5; C4=2\\n40\\n152\\n883\\n5\\ndenote the columns of the matrix A; note that each column represents the\\nyields across all three farms for each crop.

Notice\\nthat although we only defined the sum of two matrices in Definition 5.1.4 ,\\nit makes sense to add any number of matrices, and there is no need to add\\nparentheses.\\nƈƎƉ Note: In Linear Algebra, a scalar\\nis simply a number. F or most of this\\ntext, the scalars we consider are real\\nnumbers, although one can also use\\ncomplex numbers as scalars. (Com-\\nplex numbers will be introduced in\\nChapter 2.) As we saw in Chapter 3,\\nmultiplying a vector by a scalar scales\\nthe length of that vector.ƌ.ƈ MatrixAddiࢢonandScalarMulࢢplicaࢢon\\nRecall from Chapter 3that we defined the multiplication of a vector\\n⃗ v=⟨a; b; c⟩by a scalar t2R by\\nt⃗ v=t⟨a; b; c⟩=⟨ta; tb; tc ⟩:\\nIt stands to reason that scalar multiplication should be defined in ex-\\nactly the same way for row and column vectors; after all, in most cases\\nthese are just different ways of writing down the same mathematical ob-\\nject. Thus, in order to multiply a row or column vector by a scalar, we\\nshould multiply each entry in the vector by that scalar. F rom here, it’s not\\ntoo much of a stretch to conclude that the same definition is reasonable\\nfor matrices in general.\\nDefinition 5.1.5 Scalar Multiplication\\nLetA= [aij]be an m\\x02nmatrix and let kbe a scalar.

F or example, F arm A produced\\n48 tonnes of corn in 2014, and 41 tonnes of corn in 2015. The two-year\\naverage for corn on F arm A is thus\\n48 + 41\\n2=89\\n2= 44:5tonnes :\\nNotice that we can obtain the average for each entry by dividing each\\nentry in T=A+B by 2, which is the same thing as multiplying by1\\n2.\\nOur matrix of averages is\\n1\\n2T=1\\n22\\n489 43 107 20\\n0 72 73 317\\n81 396 0 1653\\n5=2\\n489/2 43/2 107/2 10\\n0 36 73/2 317/2\\n81/2 198 0 165/23\\n5:\\nFinally , notice also that since\\n48 + 41\\n2=1\\n2(48) +1\\n2(41);\\nwith similar considerations for the other entries, we also could have ob-\\ntained the average by first dividing A andB by1\\n2, and then adding the\\nresult.

Rather than perform the same set of row\\noperations for each vector separately , we can do them all together. (See\\nthe discussion following Example 4.5.7 .)\\nThus, we are once again making use of the following fact:\\nThe columns of a matrix product AX areAtimes the columns\\nofX.\\nHow does this help us solve the matrix equation AX =B forX?\\nAssume that A is a square matrix (that forces X andB to be the same\\nsize).

This means we need to solve\\nnequations:\\nA ⃗ x1=⃗b1\\nA ⃗ x2=⃗b2\\n...=...\\nA ⃗ xn=⃗bn\\nƉƈƌ Chapterƌ MatrixAlgebra\\nW e already know how to do this; this is what we learned in the previous\\nsection. Let’s do this in a concrete example. In our above work we defined\\nmatrices A andX, and looked at the product AX . Let’s call the product\\nB; that is, set B=AX . Now, let’s pretend that we don’t know what X\\nis, and let’s try to find the matrix X that satisfies the equation AX =B.\\nAs a refresher, recall that\\nA=[\\n1 2\\n3 4]\\nand B=[\\n3 1 17\\n7 1 39]\\n:\\nSince A is a 2\\x022matrix and B is a 2\\x023matrix, what dimensions\\nmust X be in the equation AX =B? The number of rows of X must\\nmatch the number of columns of A; the number of columns of X must\\nmatch the number of columns of B. Therefore we know that X must be\\na2\\x023matrix.\\nW e’ll call the three columns of X ⃗ x 1,⃗ x2and⃗ x3. Our previous expla-\\nnation tells us that if AX =B, then:\\nAX =B\\nA[⃗ x1⃗ x2⃗ x3]\\n=[3 1 17\\n7 1 39]\\n[A ⃗ x1A ⃗ x2A ⃗ x3]\\n=[3 1 17\\n7 1 39]\\n:\\nHence\\nA ⃗ x1=[3\\n7]\\nA ⃗ x2=[1\\n1]\\nA ⃗ x3=[\\n17\\n39]\\nT o find ⃗ x1, we form the proper augmented matrix and put it into\\nreduced row echelon form and interpret the results.\\n[1 2 3\\n3 4 7]\\x00 !rref[1 0 1\\n0 1 1]\\nThis shows us that\\n⃗ x1=[1\\n1]\\n:\\nT o find ⃗ x2, we again form an augmented matrix and interpret its re-\\nduced row echelon form.\\n[1 2 1\\n3 4 1]\\x00 !rref[1 0 \\x001\\n0 1 1]\\nThus\\n⃗ x2=[\\x001\\n1]\\nwhich matches with what we already knew from above.\\nBefore continuing on in this manner to find ⃗ x3, we should stop and\\nthink. If the matrix vector equation A⃗ x=⃗bis consistent, then the steps\\ninvolved in putting[\\nA⃗b]\\nƉƈҚ ƌ.Ɗ SolvingMatrixEquaࢢons AX =B\\ninto reduced row echelon form depend only on A; it does not matter what\\n⃗bis. So when we put the two matrices\\n[1 2 3\\n3 4 7]\\nand[1 2 1\\n3 4 1]\\nfrom above into reduced row echelon form, we performed exactly the same\\nsteps! (In fact, those steps are: \\x003R1+R2!R2;\\x001\\n2R2!R2;\\x002R2+\\nR1!R1.)\\nThis is just as we noted after Example 4.5.7 . Instead of solving for each\\ncolumn of X separately , performing the same steps to put the necessary\\nmatrices into reduced row echelon form three different times, why don’t\\nwe just do it all at once? (Unless you enjoy doing unnecessary work.)\\nInstead of individually putting\\n[1 2 3\\n3 4 7]\\n;[1 2 1\\n3 4 1]\\nand[1 2 17\\n3 4 39]\\ninto reduced row echelon form, let’s just put\\n[1 2 3 1 17\\n3 4 7 1 39]\\ninto reduced row echelon form.\\n[\\n1 2 3 1 17\\n3 4 7 1 39]\\x00 !rref[\\n1 0 1\\x001 5\\n0 1 1 1 6]\\nBy looking at the last three columns, we see X:\\nX=[1\\x001 5\\n1 1 6]\\n:\\nIn each of the examples we’ve considered so far, the reduced row eche-\\nlon form R of the matrix Awas equal to the n\\x02nidentity matrix: R=I.\\nIt follows from Definition 4.6.4 in Section 4.6 that for an n\\x02nmatrix A,\\nwe have R=Iif and only if the rank of A is equal to n. At this point\\nwe should recall Theorem 4.6.1 from Section 4.6 , and the discussion that\\nfollowed. One of the things Theorem 4.6.1 tells us is that if A is an n\\x02n\\nmatrix and rank (A) =n, then the equation A⃗ x =⃗bis guaranteed to\\nhave a unique solution, no matter what the vector ⃗bis.\\nBut what if rank (A)< n ? In this case, the reduced row echelon form\\nofA is an n\\x02nmatrix R with at least row of zeros on the bottom. Our\\nexperience with solving systems of the form A⃗ x=⃗btells us that in this\\ncase, the matrix equation AX =B may have infinitely many solutions, or\\nno solution at all. Let us consider an example.\\nExample ƌ.Ɗ.Ɗ Solving AX =B when rank (A)< n\\nSolve the matrix equations AX =B andAX =C, where\\nA=2\\n41 0 \\x003\\n\\x002 3 4\\n0 6 \\x0043\\n5; B=2\\n41 2 0\\n1 1 3\\n6 3 03\\n5;andC=2\\n44\\x002\\x003\\n\\x006 5 7\\n4 2 23\\n5:\\nSolution W e proceed as in the previous examples.

What this tells us is that it will be impossible to solve for the\\nsecond and third columns of X; thus, there is no solution in this case.\\nF or the equation AX =C, we have\\n[AC]\\n=2\\n41 0 \\x003 4\\x002\\x003\\n\\x002 3 4 \\x006 5 7\\n0 6 \\x004 4 2 23\\n5\\x00 !rref2\\n41 0 \\x003 4\\x002 3\\n0 1 \\x002/3 2/3 1/3 1/3\\n0 0 0 0 0 03\\n5:\\nIn this case, we are able to solve for each column of X, but in each case\\nthere are infinitely many possibilities: we find X=[⃗ x1⃗ x2⃗ x3]\\n, where\\n⃗ x1=2\\n44 + 3r\\n2\\n3+2\\n3r\\nr3\\n5; ⃗ x2=2\\n4\\x002 + 3s\\n1\\n3+2\\n3s\\ns3\\n5; ⃗ x3=2\\n4\\x003 + 3t\\n1\\n3+2\\n3t\\nt3\\n5;\\nfor parameters r; s; t . Any choice of values for each of these parameters\\nprovides us with a solution. F or simple example, we can set all three\\nparameters equal to zero, giving us\\nX=2\\n44\\x002\\x003\\n2/3 1/3 1/3\\n0 0 03\\n5:\\nIt’s easy to check that indeed, AX =C in this case.\\nIn the previous example, we saw that the equation AX =B had no\\nsolution, while we were able to solve AX =C. How do we know which of\\nthese will be the case? Let’s go back to Equation (ƌ.Ɖ)above. F rom this\\nequation, we can see that each column of B is of the form ⃗bi=A⃗ xifor\\nsome vector ⃗ xi. Now recall from Section 3.7 that the set of vectors of the\\nform A⃗ x is precisely the column space of A. In the case of the matrix C,\\nwe can check that if we write\\nA=[⃗ a1⃗ a2⃗ a3]\\nandC=[⃗ c1⃗ c2⃗ c3]\\n;\\nthen ⃗ c1=⃗ a1\\x00⃗ a2,⃗ c2=⃗ a1+⃗ a2+⃗ a3, and ⃗ c3=⃗ a2+⃗ a3. Thus, all three\\ncolumns of C are linear combinations of the columns of A, which is what\\nallowed us to find a solution to AX =C even though the rank of A was\\nless than n.\\nNow that we’ve justified the technique we’ve been using in this section\\nto solve AX =B forX, we reinforce its importance by restating it as a\\nKey Idea.\\nƉƈқ ƌ.Ɗ SolvingMatrixEquaࢢons AX =B\\nKey Idea 5.3.1 Solving AX =B\\nLetA be an n\\x02nmatrix, where the reduced row echelon form of\\nA isI.

One of these we\\nasked (and answered) above: What if A does not have maximum rank,\\nso that the reduced row echelon form of A is not equal to I? Second, we\\nspecify above that A should be a square matrix. What happens if A isn’t\\nsquare? Is a solution still possible? If you study what happens in Example\\n5.3.3 carefully , you can probably guess that a similar argument applies,\\nby applying the ideas of Section 4.6 to each column of B individually .\\nThese questions are good to ask, and we leave it to the reader to dis-\\ncover their answers. Instead of tackling these questions, we instead tackle\\nthe problem of “Why do we care about solving AX =B?” The simple\\nanswer is that, for now, we only care about the special case when B=I.\\nBy solving AX =IforX, we find a matrix X that, when multiplied by\\nA, gives the identity I.

However, we do know how to solve the matrix equation\\nƉƉƈ Chapterƌ MatrixAlgebra\\nAX =B, so we can use that technique to solve the equation AX =Ifor\\nX. This seems like it will get us close to what we want. Let’s practice\\nthis once and then study our results.\\nExample ƌ.Ƌ.ƈ Solving AX =I\\nLet\\nA=[2 1\\n1 1]\\n:\\nFind a matrix X such that AX =I.\\nSolution W e know how to solve this from the previous section:\\nwe form the proper augmented matrix, put it into reduced row echelon\\nform and interpret the results.\\n[2 1 1 0\\n1 1 0 1]\\x00 !rref[1 0 1\\x001\\n0 1 \\x001 2]\\nW e read from our matrix that\\nX=[1\\x001\\n\\x001 2]\\n:\\nLet’s check our work:\\nAX =[2 1\\n1 1][1\\x001\\n\\x001 2]\\n=[\\n1 0\\n0 1]\\n=I\\nSure enough, it works.\\nLooking at our previous example, we are tempted to jump in and call\\nthe matrix X that we found “ A\\x001. ” However, there are two obstacles in\\nthe way of us doing this.\\nFirst, we know that in general AB̸=BA . So while we found that\\nAX =I, we can’t automatically assume that XA =I.\\nSecondly , we have seen examples of matrices where AB =AC , but\\nB̸=C. So just because AX =I, it is possible that another matrix Y\\nexists where AY =I. If this is the case, using the notation A\\x001would be\\nmisleading, since it could refer to more than one matrix.\\nThese obstacles that we face are not insurmountable. The first obstacle\\nwas that we know that AX =Ibut didn’t know that XA =I. That’s\\neasy enough to check, though. Let’s look at A andX from our previous\\nexample.\\nXA =[1\\x001\\n\\x001 2][2 1\\n1 1]\\n=[1 0\\n0 1]\\n=I\\nPerhaps this first obstacle isn’t much of an obstacle after all.

If there is a matrix X such that AX =In, then XA =In.\\n2. If there is a matrix X such that XA =In, then AX =In.\\nThe second obstacle is easier to address. W e want to know if another\\nmatrix Yexists where AY =I=Y A . Let’s suppose that it does. Consider\\nthe expression XAY . Since matrix multiplication is associative, we can\\ngroup this any way we choose. W e could group this as (XA)Y; this results\\nin\\n(XA)Y=IY\\n=Y:\\nW e could also group XAY asX(AY). This tells us\\nX(AY) =XI\\n=X\\nCombining the two ideas above, we see that X=XAY =Y; that is,\\nX=Y. W e conclude that there is only one matrix X where XA =I=\\nAX . (Even if we think we have two, we can do the above exercise and see\\nthat we really just have one.)\\nW e have just proved the following theorem.\\nTheorem 5.4.2 Uniqueness of Solutions to AX =In\\nLetA be an n\\x02nmatrix and let X be a matrix where AX =In.\\nThen X is unique; it is the only matrix that satisfies this equation.\\nIn other words, if A is an n\\x02nmatrix and AX =AY =In, then\\nX=Y=A\\x001.\\nThus, we were justified in Definition 5.4.1 in calling A\\x001“the” inverse\\nofA (rather than merely “an” inverse). Theorem 5.4.2 is incredibly im-\\nportant in practice. It tells us that if we are able to establish that either\\nAX =InorXA =Infor some matrix X, then we can immediately con-\\nclude two things: first, that A is invertible, and second, that A=A\\x001.\\nW e put this observation to use in the next example.\\nExample ƌ.Ƌ.Ɖ Using Theorems 5.4.1 and 5.4.2\\nSuppose Ais ann\\x02nmatrix such that A5=In.

If everyone is spe-\\ncial, then no one is. Then again, ev-\\neryone is special.Chapterƌ MatrixAlgebra\\nThus, if we set X=A4, then AX =In, so by Theorems 5.4.1 and 5.4.2 ,\\nA is invertible, and A\\x001=A4.\\nAt this point, it is natural to wonder which n\\x02nmatrices will be\\ninvertible. Will any non-zero matrix do? (No.) Are such matrices a rare\\noccurrence? (No.) As we proceed through this chapter and the next, we\\nwill see that there are many different conditions one can place on an n\\x02n\\nmatrix that are equivalent to the statement “The matrix A is invertible. ”\\nBefore we begin our attempt to answer this question in general, let’s look\\nat a particular example.\\nExample ƌ.Ƌ.Ɗ A non-invertible matrix\\nFind the inverse of A=[1 2\\n2 4]\\n.\\nSolution By solving the equation AX =IforX will give us the\\ninverse of A.

W e were expecting to find that the reduced row echelon form of\\nthis matrix would look like\\n[IA\\x001]\\n:\\nHowever, we don’t have the identity on the left hand side. Our conclusion:\\nA is not invertible.\\nW e have just seen that not all matrices are invertible. The attentive\\nreader might have been able to spot the source of the trouble in the pre-\\nvious example: notice that the second row of A is a multiple of the first,\\nso that the row operation R2\\x002R1!R2created a row of zeros. Can\\nyou think what sort of condition would signal trouble for a general n\\x02n\\nmatrix? Here, we need to think back to our discussions of the various\\ntheoretical concepts we’ve encountered, such as rank, span, linear inde-\\npendence, and so on. Let us think of the rows of A as row vectors. The\\nelementary row operations that we perform on a matrix either rearrange\\nthese vectors, or create new vectors that are linear combinations of the\\nold ones. The only way we end up with a row of zeros in the reduced row\\nechelon form of A is if one of the rows of A can be written as a linear\\ncombination of the others; that is, if the rows of A are linearly dependent .\\nW e also know that if there is a row of zeros in the reduced row echelon\\nform of A, then not every row contains a leading 1. Recalling that the\\nrank of A is equal to the number of leading 1s in the reduced row echelon\\nform of A, we have the following:\\nƉƉƋ Here’s a useful exercise for the reader\\nto consider: can you prove in general\\nthat for a 2\\x022matrix A, if one row\\nofA is a multiple of the other, then\\nthe same is true of the columns? (W e\\ncan see that this is the case in Exam-\\nple 5.4.3 .) A fundamental theorem in\\nlinear algebra states that for a general\\nm\\x02nmatrix, the number of linearly\\nindependent rows is equal to the num-\\nber of linearly independent columns.\\nThe proof of this fact is rather techni-\\ncal, so we have not included it in this\\nbook. However, the rough idea is to\\nfollow the leading 1s: in the reduced\\nrow echelon form of A, each leading\\n1 occupies both a row and a column,\\nand the rows (or columns) that end\\nup with leading 1s are the ones that\\nare linearly independent.ƌ.Ƌ TheMatrixInverse\\nTheorem 5.4.3 Inverses and rank\\nLetA be an n\\x02n matrix. Then the following statements are\\nequivalent:\\n1. The matrix A is invertible.\\n2. The rank of A is equal to n.\\n3. The rows of A are linearly independent.\\n4. The columns of A are linearly independent.\\nThe claim that “the following statements are equivalent” in Theorem\\n5.4.3 means that as soon as we know that one of the statements on the list\\nis true, we can immediately conclude that the others are true as well. This\\nis also the case if we know one of the statements is false. F or example, if\\nwe know that rank (A)< n , then we can immediately conclude that Awill\\nnot be invertible.\\nLet’s sum up what we’ve learned so far.

T/F: Solving A⃗ x=⃗busing Gaussian elimination is faster than using\\nthe inverse of A.\\nW e ended the previous section by stating that invertible matrices are\\nimportant. Since they are, in this section we study invertible matrices\\nin two ways. First, we look at ways to tell whether or not a matrix is\\ninvertible, and second, we study properties of invertible matrices (that is,\\nhow they interact with other matrix operations).\\nIn the last section we stated Theorem 5.4.3 , in which we listed several\\nproperties of a matrix that equivalent to that matrix being invertible,\\nincluding the fact that an n\\x02nmatrix must have rank nin order to be\\ninvertible.\\nW e begin this section by collecting additional properties that are equiv-\\nalent to matrix a matrix being invertible. Some of these results were es-\\ntablished in the previous section, but we state them again here for ease of\\nreference.\\nTheorem 5.5.1 Invertible Matrix Theorem\\nLetAbe an n\\x02nmatrix. The following statements are equivalent.\\n(a)A is invertible.\\n(b) The equation A⃗ x=⃗Ɔhas exactly one solution (namely , ⃗ x=\\n⃗Ɔ).\\n(c) The reduced row echelon form of A isI.\\n(d) The equation A⃗ x=⃗bhas exactly one solution for every n\\x021\\nvector ⃗b.\\n(e) There exists a matrix C such that AC =I.\\n(f) There exists a matrix B such that BA =I.\\nNote that the theorem uses the phrase “the following statements are\\nequivalent. ” Recall that when two or more statements are equivalent, it\\nmeans that the truth of any one of them implies that the rest are also true;\\nif any one of the statements is false, then they are all false. So, for example,\\nif we determined that the equation A⃗ x=⃗Ɔhad exactly one solution (and\\nA was an n\\x02nmatrix) then we would know that A was invertible, that\\nƉƊƈ Chapterƌ MatrixAlgebra\\nA⃗ x =⃗bhad only one solution, that the reduced row echelon form of A\\nwasI, etc.\\nLet’s see exactly why all of these statements are equivalent. What we\\nwill do is establish the following chain of logic:\\n(a))(b))(c))(d))(e))(f))(a):\\nSince this chain of implications circles back on itself, each of the statements\\nimplies the others. (F or example, to show (e) implies (c), we start at (e)\\nand circle around through (a) until we get to (c).\\n• (a)) (b): Suppose A⃗ x=⃗Ɔfor some vector ⃗ x. Since Ais invertible,\\nwe can multiply both sides of this equation by A\\x001, giving us\\n⃗ x=I⃗ x= (A\\x001A)⃗ x=A\\x001(A⃗ x) =A\\x001⃗Ɔ=⃗Ɔ:\\nThus, the only possible solution to the system is ⃗ x=⃗Ɔ.\\n• (b)) (c): Suppose the only solution to A⃗ x =⃗Ɔis⃗ x=⃗Ɔ. Why\\nmust the reduced row echelon form of A be equal to I? If we let R\\ndenote the reduced row echelon form of A, we know that to solve\\nA⃗ x=⃗Ɔ, we form the augmented matrix[\\nA⃗Ɔ]\\nand reduce:\\n[\\nA⃗Ɔ]\\x00 !rref[\\nR⃗Ɔ]\\nIf the R̸=I, then R has a row of zeros, and thus, so does[\\nR⃗Ɔ]\\n,\\nin which case the system A⃗ x=⃗Ɔwould have at least one parameter,\\nand thus infinitely many solutions. Since we’re assuming that A⃗ x=\\n⃗Ɔhas the unique solution ⃗ x=⃗Ɔ, it follows that R cannot have a row\\nof zeros, and thus R=I.\\n• (c)) (d): Suppose that the reduced row echelon form of A is equal\\ntoI. It follows that when solving the system A⃗ x=⃗b, we would have\\n[\\nA⃗b]\\x00 !rref[I⃗ c]\\nfor some column vector ⃗ c, and thus ⃗ x=⃗ cis the unique solution to\\nA⃗ x=⃗b.\\n• (d)) (e): Suppose that A⃗ x =⃗bhas a unique solution for every\\ncolumn vector ⃗b. Then in particular, we have a unique solution ⃗ cj\\nto the systems A⃗ x=⃗ ejforj= 1; : : : ; n , where ⃗ e1; ⃗ e2; : : : ; ⃗ e nare the\\nstandard basis vectors in Rn(and also the columns of In). If we let\\nC=[⃗ c1⃗ c2\\x01\\x01\\x01⃗ cn]\\n;\\nthen\\nAC =[\\nA⃗ c1A⃗ c2\\x01\\x01\\x01A⃗ cn]\\n=[\\n⃗ e1⃗ e2\\x01\\x01\\x01 ⃗ en]\\n=In:\\n• (e)) (f): Suppose that AC =Infor some n\\x02nmatrix C. W e\\nclaim that Property 2holds for the matrix C. T o see this, note that\\nsince AC =In, ifC⃗ x=⃗Ɔ, then\\n⃗ x=In(⃗ x) = (AC)⃗ x=A(C⃗ x) =A⃗Ɔ=⃗Ɔ:\\nSince Property 2holds for the matrix C, it follows that Properties\\n3,4, and 5do as well, by what we’ve proven so far. Thus, there\\nƉƊƉ Think about how we, up to this point,\\ndetermined the solution to A⃗ x =\\n⃗b. W e set up the augmented ma-\\ntrix[\\nA⃗b]\\nand put it into reduced\\nrow echelon form. W e know that get-\\nting the identity matrix on the left\\nmeans that we had a unique solution\\n(and not getting the identity means\\nwe either have no solution or infinitely\\nmany solutions). So getting Ion the\\nleft means having a unique solution;\\nhaving Ion the left means that the\\nreduced row echelon form of A isI,\\nwhich we know is the same as A be-\\ning invertible.ƌ.ƌ ProperࢢesoftheMatrixInverse\\nexists a matrix D such that CD =In. W e can complete our proof\\nby showing that D=A, and this is the case since (recalling that\\nwe’ve assumed AC =In)\\nA=A(In) =A(CD) = (AC)D=InD=D:\\nThus, (f) holds. (Note that this argument finally establishes the\\ntruth of Theorem 5.4.1 .)\\n• (f)) (a): Suppose that BA =Infor some matrix B. Using the\\nsame argument we just gave, it then follows that AB =In, and if\\nAB =BA =In, then by definition A is invertible and B=A\\x001.\\nSo we came up with a list of statements that are all equivalent to the\\nstatement “ A is invertible. ” Again, if we know that if any one of them is\\ntrue (or false), then they are all true (or all false).\\nTheorem 5.5.1 states formally that if A is invertible, then A⃗ x=⃗bhas\\nexactly one solution, namely A\\x001⃗b. What if Ais not invertible? What are\\nthe possibilities for solutions to A⃗ x=⃗b?\\nW e know that A⃗ x=⃗bcannot have exactly one solution; if it did, then\\nby our theorem it would be invertible. Recalling that linear equations have\\neither one solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solution, we are left\\nwith the latter options when A is not invertible. This idea is important\\nand so we’ll state it again as a Key Idea.\\nKey Idea 5.5.1 Solutions to A⃗ x=⃗band the Invertibility\\nofA\\nConsider the system of linear equations A⃗ x=⃗b.\\n1.

IfA is not invertible, then A⃗ x=⃗bhas either infinitely many\\nsolutions or no solution.\\nIn Theorem 5.5.1 we’ve come up with a list of ways in which we can\\ntell whether or not a matrix is invertible. At the same time, we have come\\nup with a list of properties of invertible matrices – things we know that\\nare true about them. (F or instance, if we know that A is invertible, then\\nwe know that A⃗ x=⃗bhas only one solution.)\\nW e now go on to discover other properties of invertible matrices. Specif-\\nically , we want to find out how invertibility interacts with other matrix\\noperations. F or instance, if we know that A andB are invertible, what is\\nthe inverse of A+B? What is the inverse of AB ? What is “the inverse\\nof the inverse?” W e’ll explore these questions through an example.\\nExample ƌ.ƌ.ƈ Exploring properties of the inverse\\nLet\\nA=[3 2\\n0 1]\\nandB=[\\x002 0\\n1 1]\\n:\\nFind:\\nƉƊƊ Chapterƌ MatrixAlgebra\\n1.A\\x001\\n2.B\\x0013.(AB)\\x001\\n4.(A\\x001)\\x0015.(A+B)\\x001\\n6.(5A)\\x001\\nIn addition, try to find connections between each of the above.\\nSolution\\n1.

Is there some sort of relationship between (AB)\\x001andA\\x001and\\nB\\x001? A first guess that seems plausible is (AB)\\x001=A\\x001B\\x001. Is\\nthis true?

Before we do some further\\nguessing, let’s think about what the inverse of AB is supposed to\\ndo. The inverse – let’s call it C – is supposed to be a matrix such\\nthat\\n(AB)C=C(AB) =I:\\nIn examining the expression (AB)C, we see that we want B to some-\\nhow “cancel” with C. What “cancels” B? An obvious answer is B\\x001.\\nThis gives us a thought: perhaps we got the order of A\\x001andB\\x001\\nwrong before. After all, we were hoping to find that\\nABA\\x001B\\x001 ?=I;\\nbut algebraically speaking, it is hard to cancel out these terms.(Recall\\nthat matrix multiplication is not commutative: AB̸=BA in gen-\\neral.) However, switching the order of A\\x001andB\\x001gives us some\\nhope. Is (AB)\\x001=B\\x001A\\x001? Let’s see.\\n(AB)(B\\x001A\\x001) =A(BB\\x001)A\\x001(regroupingbytheassociaࢢveproperty)\\n=AIA\\x001(BB\\x001=I)\\n=AA\\x001(AI=A)\\n=I AA\\x001=I)\\nSince (AB)(B\\x001A\\x001) =In, we know immediately from Theorem\\n5.5.1 that (AB)\\x001=B\\x001A\\x001. Note also that our argument above\\nwas completely general, so this result holds true for any pair of n\\x02n\\nmatrices A andB. Let’s confirm this with our example matrices.\\nB\\x001A\\x001=[\\x001/2 0\\n1/2 1][1/3\\x002/3\\n0 1]\\n=[\\x001/6 1/3\\n1/6 2/3]\\n= (AB)\\x001:\\nIt worked!\\n4. Is there some sort of connection between (A\\x001)\\x001andA? The\\nanswer is pretty obvious: they are equal. The “inverse of the inverse”\\nreturns one to the original matrix.\\n5. Is there some sort of relationship between (A+B)\\x001,A\\x001andB\\x001?\\nCertainly , if we were forced to make a guess without working any\\nexamples, we would guess that\\n(A+B)\\x001 ?=A\\x001+B\\x001:\\nHowever, we saw that in our example, the matrix (A+B)isn’t even\\ninvertible. This pretty much kills any hope of a connection.\\n6. Is there a connection between (5A)\\x001andA\\x001? Consider:\\n(5A)\\x001=[\\n1/15 \\x002/15\\n0 1/5]\\n=1\\n5[1/3\\x002/3\\n0 1/5]\\n=1\\n5A\\x001\\nY es, there is a connection!\\nƉƊƌ A natural question to ask at this\\npoint is whether or not the product\\nof two non-invertible matrices could\\never be invertible. The answer, not\\nsurprisingly , is “No. ” T o see this, sup-\\npose AB is invertible. Then we know\\nthat the only solution to the equa-\\ntion (AB)⃗ x=⃗Ɔ is⃗ x=⃗Ɔ. But if\\nB is not invertible, then the equation\\nB⃗ x=⃗Ɔdoes have a non-trivial solu-\\ntion⃗ x̸=⃗Ɔ, and then\\n(AB)⃗ x=A(B⃗ x) =A⃗Ɔ=⃗Ɔ;\\nimplying that ⃗ xis a non-zero solution\\nto(AB)⃗ x=⃗Ɔ, and thus AB cannot\\nbe invertible.The fact that invertibility works well\\nwith matrix multiplication should not\\ncome as a surprise. After all, say-\\ning that A is invertible makes a state-\\nment about the mulitiplicative prop-\\nerties of A. It says that I can multiply\\nA with a special matrix to get I. In-\\nvertibility , in and of itself, says noth-\\ning about matrix addition, therefore\\nwe should not be too surprised that\\nit doesn’t work well with it.\\nW e still haven’t formally defined di-\\nagonal , but the definition is rather vi-\\nsual so we risk it. See Definition 7.1.2\\non page 302 for more details.Chapterƌ MatrixAlgebra\\nLet’s summarize the results of this example. If A andB are both\\ninvertible matrices, then so is their product, AB . W e demonstrated this\\nwith our example, and there is more to be said. Let’s suppose that A and\\nB aren\\x02nmatrices, but we don’t yet know if they are invertible. If AB\\nis invertible, then each of AandB are; if AB is not invertible, then either\\nA orB is not invertible.\\nIn short, invertibility “works well” with matrix multiplication. How-\\never, we saw that it doesn’t work well with matrix addition. Knowing\\nthatA andB are invertible does not help us find the inverse of (A+B);\\nin fact, the latter matrix may not even be invertible.\\nLet’s do one more example, then we’ll summarize the results of this\\nsection in a theorem.\\nExample ƌ.ƌ.Ɖ Computing the inverse of a diagonal matrix\\nFind the inverse of A=2\\n42 0 0\\n0 3 0\\n0 0 \\x0073\\n5.\\nSolution W e’ll find A\\x001using Key Idea 5.4.1 .\\n2\\n42 0 0 1 0 0\\n0 3 0 0 1 0\\n0 0 \\x007 0 0 13\\n5\\x00 !rref2\\n41 0 0 1/2 0 0\\n0 1 0 0 1/3 0\\n0 0 1 0 0 \\x001/73\\n5\\nTherefore\\nA\\x001=2\\n41/2 0 0\\n0 1/3 0\\n0 0 \\x001/73\\n5:\\nThe matrix A in the previous example is a diagonal matrix: the only\\nnonzero entries of A lie on the diagonal .

Not just mathemati-\\ncians, but economists, engineers, and\\nscientists of all flavours regularly need\\nto solve linear equations, and the ma-\\ntrices they use are often huge.\\nMost people see matrices at work\\nwithout thinking about it. Digital\\npictures are simply “rectangular ar-\\nrays” of numbers representing colours\\n– they are matrices of colours. Many\\nof the standard image processing op-\\nerations involve matrix operations.\\nThe author’s wife has a “7 megapixel”\\ncamera which creates pictures that\\nare3072\\x022304 in size, giving over\\n7 million pixels, and that isn’t even\\nconsidered a “large” picture these\\ndays.ƌ.ƌ ProperࢢesoftheMatrixInverse\\nW e end this section with a comment about solving systems of equations\\n“in real life. ” Solving a system A⃗ x=⃗bby computing A\\x001⃗bseems pretty\\nslick, so it would make sense that this is the way it is normally done.\\nHowever, in practice, this is rarely done. There are two main reasons why\\nthis is the case.\\nFirst, computing A\\x001andA\\x001⃗bis “expensive” in the sense that it takes\\nup a lot of computing time. Certainly , our calculators have no trouble\\ndealing with the 3\\x023cases we often consider in this textbook, but in\\nreal life the matrices being considered are very large (as in, hundreds of\\nthousand rows and columns). Computing A\\x001alone is rather impractical,\\nand we waste a lot of time if we come to find out that A\\x001does not exist.\\nEven if we already know what A\\x001is, computing A\\x001⃗bis computationally\\nexpensive – Gaussian elimination is faster.\\nSecondly , computing A\\x001using the method we’ve described often gives\\nrise to numerical roundoff errors. Even though computers often do compu-\\ntations with an accuracy to more than 8 decimal places, after thousands of\\ncomputations, rounding off can cause big errors. (A “small” 1;000\\x021;000\\nmatrix has 1;000;000 entries! That’s a lot of places to have roundoff errors\\naccumulate!) It is not unheard of to have a computer compute A\\x001for\\na large matrix, and then immediately have it compute AA\\x001and not get\\nthe identity matrix. (The result is usually very close, with the numbers\\non the diagonal close to 1 and the other entries near 0. But it isn’t exactly\\nthe identity matrix.)\\nTherefore, in real life, solutions to A⃗ x=⃗bare usually found using the\\nmethods we learned in Section 4.6 . It turns out that even with all of our\\nadvances in mathematics, it is hard to beat the basic method that Gauss\\nintroduced a long time ago.\\nƉƊƍ Exercises 5.5\\nProblems\\nIn Exercises ƈ – Ƌ, matrices AandBare given.

Ele-\\nmentary matrices are relatively simple objects, as their name suggests,\\nbut as we will see, they give us a simple method for understanding why\\nour algorithm for computing the inverse of a matrix works. When we\\nreach the discussion of determinants and their properties, we’ll also see\\nthat elementary matrices provide a simple proof of an important result:\\nthe product rule for determinants.\\nDefinition 5.6.1 Elementary Matrix\\nAn elementary matrix is an n\\x02nmatrix E that can be obtained\\nfrom the identity matrix using a single row operation.\\nNote that by reversing the elementary row operation used to create an\\nn\\x02nelementary matrix E, we could equally well say that E is a matrix of\\nrank nthat is one row operation away from its reduced row-echelon form\\n(namely , the identity matrix).\\nThe following are examples of elementary matrices, along with the\\nelementary row operation used to obtain it from the identity:\\nE1=[1 2\\n0 1]\\nR1!R1+ 2R2\\nE2=2\\n41 0 0\\n0 0 1\\n0 1 03\\n5 R2$R3\\nE3=[4 0\\n0 1]\\n4R1!R1\\nE4=2\\n41 0 0\\n01\\n50\\n0 0 13\\n51\\n5R2!R2\\nE5=2\\n41 0 0\\n0 1 \\x004\\n0 0 13\\n5 R2\\x004R3!R2\\nThe main reason that elementary matrices are useful is that they give\\nus a way of encoding (or more to the point, keeping track of) the ele-\\nmentary row operations used to define them. The primary result is the\\nfollowing:\\nTheorem 5.6.1 Effect of Multiplication by an Elemen-\\ntary Matrix\\nLetAbe an n\\x02kmatrix and suppose that the matrix B is obtained\\nfrom A using an elementary row operation.

If we apply a row\\noperation of the type Ri$Rjto a matrix, applying it again will return\\nour matrix to its original state. (Swapping two rows and then swapping\\nthem back again results in no net change.) It follows that any “Type 1”\\nelementary matrix obtained by a row operation of this type is its own\\ninverse. In terms of row operations,\\nIRi$Rj\\x00 \\x00 \\x00 \\x00 \\x00 ! ERi$Rj\\x00 \\x00 \\x00 \\x00 \\x00 !

It follows from\\nthe definition of the inverse that E=E\\x001.\\nNow let us consider the other two types of row operation. F or a “Type\\n2” elementary matrix, obtained using a row operation of the type kRi!\\nRi, we multiply one of the rows of our matrix by a common constant\\nk̸= 0 . If we then multiply by1\\nk, we will be back to where we started.\\nThus, if E is obtained from the identity using the row operation kRi!\\nRi, then E\\x001is obtained from the identity using the row operation1\\nkRi!\\nRi. F or any matrix A we have\\nAkRi!Ri\\x00 \\x00 \\x00 \\x00 \\x00 ! EA1\\nkRi!Ri\\x00 \\x00 \\x00 \\x00 \\x00 \\x00 ! E\\x001(EA) =A:\\nFinally , for a “Type 3” elementary matrix, obtained from the identity\\nusing a row operation of the type Ri+kRj!Ri, we add a multiple\\nof one row to another. If we want to undo the affect of adding row j\\nto row i, we simply subtract the same multiple of row jto row i.

(W e’ll answer this in\\nSection 8.1 when we learn about something called “eigenvectors. ”)\\nDifferent matrices act on vectors in different ways. (That’s one reason\\nwe call them “different. ”) Some always increase the length of a vector\\nthrough multiplication, others always decrease the length, others increase\\nthe length of some vectors and decrease the length of others, and others\\nstill don’t change the length at all.

W e could just create lots of different matrices and lots of different\\nvectors, multiply , then graph, but this would be a lot of work with very\\nlittle useful result. It would be too hard to find a pattern of behaviour in\\nthis. (Remember, that’s what mathematicians do. W e look for patterns.)\\nInstead, we’ll begin by using a technique we’ve employed often in the\\npast. W e have a “new” operation; let’s explore how it behaves with “old”\\noperations.

Let’s try an\\nexample.\\nExample Қ.ƈ.Ɖ Combining addition and matrix multiplication\\nLetA be a matrix and ⃗ xand⃗ ybe vectors as given below.\\nA=[1 1\\n1 2]\\n; ⃗ x =[2\\n1]\\n; ⃗ y =[\\x001\\n1]\\nSketch ⃗ x+⃗ y,A⃗ x ,A⃗ y , and A(⃗ x+⃗ y).\\nSolution It is pretty straightforward to compute:\\n⃗ x+⃗ y=[1\\n2]\\n;A⃗ x=[3\\n4]\\n;A⃗ y=[0\\n1]\\n; A (⃗ x+⃗ y) =[3\\n5]\\n:\\nIn Figure 6.2 , we have graphed the above vectors and have included\\ndashed gray vectors to highlight the additive nature of ⃗ x+⃗ yandA(⃗ x+⃗ y).\\nDoes anything strike you as interesting?\\nxy\\n⃗ x ⃗ y⃗ x+⃗ yA⃗ x\\nA⃗ yA(⃗ x+⃗ y)\\nFigure 6.2: V ector addition and matrix multiplication in Example 6.1.2 .\\nLet’s not focus on things which don’t matter right now: let’s not focus\\non how long certain vectors became, nor necessarily how their direction\\nchanged. Rather, think about how matrix multiplication interacted with\\nthe vector addition.\\nIn some sense, we started with three vectors, ⃗ x,⃗ y, and ⃗ x+⃗ y. This last\\nvector is special; it is the sum of the previous two. Now, multiply all three\\nƉƋƎ ChapterҚ MatrixTransformaࢢons\\nbyA. What happens? W e get three new vectors, but the significant thing\\nis this: the last vector is still the sum of the previous two! (W e emphasize\\nthis by drawing dotted vectors to represent part of the Parallelogram Law.)\\nOf course, we knew this already: we already knew that A⃗ x+A⃗ y=\\nA(⃗ x+⃗ y), for this is just the Distributive Property of matrix multiplication\\ngiven in Theorem 5.2.1 . However, now we get to see this graphically .\\nLet’s do one more example.\\nExample Қ.ƈ.Ɗ Sketching the effect of matrix multiplicaiton\\nLetA,⃗ x,⃗ y, and ⃗ zbe as given below.\\nA=[1\\x001\\n1\\x001]\\n; ⃗ x =[1\\n1]\\n; ⃗ y =[\\x001\\n1]\\n; ⃗ z =[4\\n1]\\nGraph ⃗ x,⃗ yand⃗ z, as well as A⃗ x ,A⃗ y andA⃗ z .\\nSolution\\nxy\\n⃗ x⃗ y ⃗ z\\nA⃗ x\\nA⃗ yA⃗ z\\nFigure 6.3: Multiplying vectors by a matrix in Example 6.1.3 .\\nIt is straightforward to compute:\\nA⃗ x=[0\\n0]\\n; A⃗ y =[\\x002\\n\\x002]\\n; and A⃗ z=[3\\n3]\\n:\\nThe vectors are sketched in Figure 6.3 .\\nThese results are interesting. While we won’t explore them in great\\ndetail here, notice how ⃗ xgot sent to the zero vector. Notice also that A⃗ x ,\\nA⃗ y andA⃗ z are all in a line (as well as ⃗ x!). Why is that? Are ⃗ x,⃗ yand⃗ z\\njust special vectors, or would any other vector get sent to the same line\\nwhen multiplied by A? (Don’t just sit there, try it out!)\\nTransformaࢢons of the Cartesian Plane\\nW e studied in Chapter 3how to visualize vectors and how the matrix\\narithmetic operations of addition and scalar multiplication can be graphi-\\ncally represented for vectors. In the discussion above, we limited our visual\\nunderstanding of matrix multiplication to graphing a vector, multiplying\\nit by a matrix, then graphing the resulting vector. In rest of this section\\nwe’ll explore these multiplication ideas in greater depth. Instead of mul-\\ntiplying individual vectors by a matrix A, we’ll study what happens when\\nwe multiply every vector in the Cartesian plans by A. (No, we won’t do\\nthem one by one.)\\nBecause of the Distributive Property , as illustrated in Example 6.1.2 ,\\nwe know that the Cartesian plane will be transformed in a very nice,\\nƉƌƇ Қ.ƈ MatrixTransformaࢢons\\npredictable way . Straight lines will be transformed into other straight\\nlines (and they won’t become curvy , or jagged, or broken). Curved lines\\nwill be transformed into other curved lines (perhaps the curve will become\\n“straight,” but it won’t become jagged or broken).\\nExample 6.1.2 has very significant implications. W e usually think of\\nthe Cartesian plane as a set of points; we can adjust this thought just\\nslightly and think of it as a set of vectors that point to each of these\\npoints. What happens to the Cartesian plane if we multiply every vector\\nin the plane by the same matrix A?\\nChecking every single vector in the plane isn’t practical, so we have to\\nlook for other ways to visualize the effects of matrix multiplication. One\\nway of studying how the whole Cartesian plane is affected by multipli-\\ncation by a matrix A is to study how the unit square is affected. The\\nunit square is the square with corners at the points (0;0),(1;0),(1;1),\\nand (0;1). Each corner can be represented by the vector that points to\\nit; multiply each of these vectors by A and we can get an idea of how A\\naffects the whole Cartesian plane.\\nLet’s try an example.\\nExample Қ.ƈ.Ƌ Visualizing a matrix transformation using vec-\\ntors\\nPlot the vectors of the unit square before and after they have been multi-\\nplied by A, where\\nA=[1 4\\n2 3]\\n:\\nSolution The four corners of the unit square can be represented\\nby the vectors[0\\n0]\\n;[1\\n0]\\n;[1\\n1]\\n;[0\\n1]\\n:\\nMultiplying each by A gives the vectors\\n[0\\n0]\\n;[1\\n2]\\n;[5\\n5]\\n;[4\\n3]\\n;\\nrespectively .\\n(Hint: one way of using your calculator to do this for you quickly is\\nto make a 2\\x024matrix whose columns are each of these vectors. In this\\ncase, create a matrix\\nB=[0 1 1 0\\n0 0 1 1]\\n:\\nThen multiply B byA and read off the transformed vectors from the\\nrespective columns:\\nAB =[0 1 5 4\\n0 2 5 3]\\n:\\nThis saves time, especially if you do a similar procedure for multiple ma-\\ntrices A. Of course, we can save more time by skipping the first column;\\nsince it is the column of zeros, it will stay the column of zeros after mul-\\ntiplication by A.)\\nThe unit square and its transformation are graphed in Figure 6.4 ,\\nwhere the shaped vertices correspond to each other across the two graphs.\\nNote how the square got turned into some sort of quadrilateral (it’s actu-\\nally a parallelogram). A really interesting thing is how the triangular and\\nsquare vertices seem to have changed places – it is as though the square,\\nin addition to being stretched out of shape, was flipped.\\nƉƌƈ ChapterҚ MatrixTransformaࢢons\\nxy\\n11\\nxy\\n11\\nFigure 6.4: T ransforming the unit square\\nby matrix multiplication in Example 6.1.4 .\\nxy\\n11\\nxy\\n11\\nFigure 6.5: Emphasizing straight lines go-\\ning to straight lines in Example 6.1.4 .\\nT o stress how “straight lines get transformed to straight lines,” consider\\nFigure 6.5 . Here, the unit square has some additional points drawn on it\\nwhich correspond to the shaded dots on the transformed parallelogram.\\nNote how relative distances are also preserved; the dot halfway between\\nthe black and square dots is transformed to a position along the line,\\nhalfway between the black and square dots.\\nMuch more can be said about this example. Before we delve into this,\\nthough, let’s try one more example.\\nExample Қ.ƈ.ƌ Visualizing a matrix transformation using a re-\\ngion\\nPlot the transformed unit square after it has been transformed by A, where\\nA=[0\\x001\\n1 0]\\n:\\nSolution W e’ll put the vectors that correspond to each corner in\\na matrix B as before and then multiply it on the left by A. Doing so gives:\\nAB =[0\\x001\\n1 0][0 1 1 0\\n0 0 1 1]\\n=[0 0 \\x001\\x001\\n0 1 1 0]\\nƉƌƉ Қ.ƈ MatrixTransformaࢢons\\nIn Figure 6.6 the unit square is again drawn along with its transfor-\\nmation by A.\\nxy\\n11\\nxy\\n1\\nFigure 6.6: T ransforming the unit square\\nby matrix multiplication in Example 6.1.5 .\\nMake note of how the square moved. It did not simply “slide” to the\\nleft; (mathematically , that is called a translation ) nor did it “flip” across\\ntheyaxis. Rather, it was rotated counterclockwise about the origin 90◦.\\nIn a rotation, the shape of an object does not change; in our example, the\\nsquare remained a square of the same size.\\nW e have broached the topic of how the Cartesian plane can be trans-\\nformed via multiplication by a 2\\x022matrix A. W e have seen a few examples\\nso far, and our intuition as to how the plane is changed has been informed\\nonly by seeing how the unit square changes. Let’s explore this further by\\ninvestigating two questions:\\n1. Suppose we want to transform the Cartesian plane in a known way\\n(for instance, we may want to rotate the plane counterclockwise\\n180◦). How do we find the matrix (if one even exists) which performs\\nthis transformation?\\n2. How does knowing how the unit square is transformed really help in\\nunderstanding how the entire plane is transformed?\\nThese questions are closely related, and as we answer one, we will help\\nanswer the other.\\nT o get started with the first question, look back at Examples 6.1.4\\nand 6.1.5 and consider again how the unit square was transformed. In\\nparticular, is there any correlation between where the vertices ended up\\nand the matrix A?\\nIf you are just reading on, and haven’t actually gone back and looked\\nat the examples, go back now and try to make some sort of connection.\\nOtherwise – you may have noted some of the following things:\\n1. The zero vector ( ⃗Ɔ, the “black” corner) never moved. That makes\\nsense, though; A⃗Ɔ=⃗Ɔ.\\n2. The “square” corner, i.e., the corner corresponding to the vector[\\n1\\n0]\\n, is always transformed to the vector in the first column of A!\\n3. Likewise, the “triangular” corner, i.e., the corner corresponding to\\nthe vector[0\\n1]\\n, is always transformed to the vector in the second\\ncolumn of A! (This is less of a surprise, given the result of the\\nprevious point.)\\nƉƌƊ ChapterҚ MatrixTransformaࢢons\\n4. The “white dot” corner is always transformed to the sum of the two\\ncolumn vectors of A. (This observation is a bit more obscure than\\nthe first three. It follows from the fact that this corner of the unit\\nsquare is the “sum” of the other two nonzero corners.)\\nLet’s now take the time to understand these four points. The first\\npoint should be clear; ⃗Ɔwill always be transformed to ⃗Ɔvia matrix mul-\\ntiplication. (Hence the hint in the middle of Example 6.1.4 , where we are\\ntold that we can ignore entering in the column of zeros in the matrix B.)\\nW e can understand the second and third points simultaneously . Let\\nA=[a b\\nc d]\\n; ⃗ e 1=[1\\n0]\\nand ⃗ e2=[0\\n1]\\n:\\nWhat are A⃗ e1andA⃗ e2?\\nA⃗ e1=[a b\\nc d][\\n1\\n0]\\n=[a\\nc]\\nA⃗ e2=[a b\\nc d][0\\n1]\\n=[b\\nd]\\nSo by mere mechanics of matrix multiplication, the square corner ⃗ e1\\nis transformed to the first column of A, and the triangular corner ⃗ e2is\\ntransformed to the second column of A. A similar argument demonstrates\\nwhy the white dot corner is transformed to the sum of the columns of A.\\n(Another way of looking at all of this is to consider what A\\x01Iis: of course,\\nit is just A. What are the columns of I? Just ⃗ e1and⃗ e2.)\\nRevisit now the question “How do we find the matrix that performs a\\ngiven transformation on the Cartesian plane?” The answer follows from\\nwhat we just did. Think about the given transformation and how it would\\ntransform the corners of the unit square. Make the first column of A the\\nvector where ⃗ e1goes, and make the second column of A the vector where\\n⃗ e2goes.\\nLet’s practice this in the context of an example.\\nExample Қ.ƈ.Қ Determining a matrix transformation\\nFind the matrix A that flips the Cartesian plane about the xaxis and\\nthen stretches the plane horizontally by a factor of two.\\nSolution W e first consider ⃗ e1=[1\\n0]\\n. Where does this corner go\\nto under the given transformation? Flipping the plane across the xaxis\\ndoes not change ⃗ e1at all; stretching the plane sends ⃗ e1to[2\\n0]\\n. Therefore,\\nthe first column of A is[2\\n0]\\n.\\nNow consider ⃗ e2=[0\\n1]\\n. Flipping the plane about the xaxis sends ⃗ e2\\nƉƌƋ Қ.ƈ MatrixTransformaࢢons\\nto the vector[0\\n\\x001]\\n; subsequently stretching the plane horizontally does\\nnot affect this vector. Therefore the second column of A is[\\n0\\n\\x001]\\n.\\nPutting this together gives\\nA=[2 0\\n0\\x001]\\n:\\nT o help visualize this, consider Figure 6.7 where a shape is transformed\\nunder this matrix. Notice how it is turned upside down and is stretched\\nhorizontally by a factor of two. (The gridlines are given as a visual aid.)\\nFigure 6.7: T ransforming the Cartesian plane in Example 6.1.6\\nA while ago we asked two questions. The first was “How do we find\\nthe matrix that performs a given transformation?” W e have just answered\\nthat question (although we will do more to explore it in the future). The\\nsecond question was “How does knowing how the unit square is trans-\\nformed really help us understand how the entire plane is transformed?”\\nConsider Figure 6.8 where the unit square (with vertices marked with\\nshapes as before) is shown transformed under an unknown matrix. How\\ndoes this help us understand how the whole Cartesian plane is trans-\\nformed? F or instance, how can we use this picture to figure out how the\\npoint (2;3) will be transformed?\\nxy\\nFigure 6.8: The unit square under an unknown transformation.\\nƉƌƌ ChapterҚ MatrixTransformaࢢons\\nThere are two ways to consider the solution to this question. First, we\\nknow now how to compute the transformation matrix; the new position\\nof⃗ e1is the first column of A, and the new position of ⃗ e2is the second\\ncolumn of A. Therefore, by looking at the figure, we can deduce that\\nA=[1\\x001\\n1 2]\\n:\\nT o find where the point (2;3) is sent, simply multiply\\n[1\\x001\\n1 2][2\\n3]\\n=[\\x001\\n8]\\n:\\nThere is another way of doing this which isn’t as computational –\\nit doesn’t involve computing the transformation matrix. Consider the\\nfollowing equalities:\\n[2\\n3]\\n=[2\\n0]\\n+[0\\n3]\\n= 2[1\\n0]\\n+ 3[0\\n1]\\n= 2⃗ e1+ 3⃗ e2\\nThis last equality states something that is somewhat obvious: to arrive\\nat the vector[2\\n3]\\n, one needs to go 2units in the ⃗ e1direction and 3units in\\nthe⃗ e2direction. T o find where the point (2;3) is transformed, one needs\\nto go 2units in the new⃗ e1direction and 3units in the new⃗ e2direction.\\nThis is demonstrated in Figure 6.9 .\\nxy\\n2\\x02 “new” ⃗ e13\\x02 “new” ⃗ e2new location of\\nthe point (2;3)\\nFigure 6.9: Finding the new location of the point (2;3).\\nW e are coming to grips with how matrix transformations work. W e\\nasked two basic questions: “How do we find the matrix for a given trans-\\nformation?” and “How do we understand the transformation without the\\nmatrix?”, and we’ve answered each accompanied by one example. Let’s\\ndo another example that demonstrates both techniques at once.\\nƉƌҚ Қ.ƈ MatrixTransformaࢢons\\nExample Қ.ƈ.ƍ Determining and analyzing a matrix transforma-\\ntion\\nFirst, find the matrix Athat transforms the Cartesian plane by stretching\\nit vertically by a factor of 1:5, then stretches it horizontally by a factor\\nof0:5, then rotates it clockwise about the origin 90◦. Secondly , using\\nthe new locations of ⃗ e1and⃗ e2, find the transformed location of the point\\n(\\x001;2).\\nSolution T o find A, first consider the new location of ⃗ e1. Stretch-\\ning the plane vertically does not affect ⃗ e1; stretching the plane horizontally\\nby a factor of 0:5changes ⃗ e1to[1/2\\n0]\\n, and then rotating it 90◦about the\\norigin moves it to[\\n0\\n\\x001/2]\\n. This is the first column of A.\\nNow consider the new location of ⃗ e2. Stretching the plane vertically\\nchanges it to[0\\n3/2]\\n; stretching horizontally does not affect it, and rotating\\n90◦moves it to[3/2\\n0]\\n. This is then the second column of A. This gives\\nA=[0 3/2\\n\\x001/2 0]\\n:\\nWhere does the point (\\x001;2) get sent to? The corresponding vector[\\n\\x001\\n2]\\nis found by going \\x001units in the ⃗ e1direction and 2units in the\\n⃗ e2direction. Therefore, the transformation will send the vector to \\x001\\nunits in the new ⃗ e1direction and 2units in the new ⃗ e2direction. This is\\nsketched in Figure 6.10 , along with the transformed unit square.

In fact, “transformation” is synonymous to “function. ”\\nW e are used to functions like f(x) =x2, where the input is a number\\nand the output is another number. In the previous section, we learned\\nabout transformations (functions) where the input was a vector and the\\nƉҚƋ W e use T instead of fto define the\\nfunction T(⃗ x) = A⃗ x to help differ-\\nentiate it from “regular” functions.\\n“Normally” functions are defined us-\\ning lower case letters when the input\\nis a number; when the input is a vec-\\ntor, we use upper case letters. (It also\\nappears to be tradition to use the let-\\nterT to describe linear transforma-\\ntions, and mathematicians are suck-\\ners for tradition.)Қ.Ɖ ProperࢢesofLinearTransformaࢢons\\noutput was another vector. If A is a “transformation matrix,” then we\\ncould create a function of the form T(⃗ x) =A⃗ x . That is, a vector ⃗ xis the\\ninput, and the output is ⃗ xmultiplied by A.\\nWhen we defined f(x) =x2above, we let the reader assume that the\\ninput was indeed a number. If we wanted to be complete, we should have\\nstated\\nf:R!R where f(x) =x2:\\nThe first part of that line told us that the input was a real number (that\\nwas the first R) and the output was also a real number (the second R).\\nT o define a transformation where a 2D vector is transformed into an-\\nother 2D vector via multiplication by a 2\\x022matrix A, we should write\\nT:R2!R2where T(⃗ x) =A⃗ x:\\nHere, the first R2means that we are using 2D vectors as our input, and\\nthe second R2means that a 2D vector is the output.\\nConsider a quick example:\\nT:R2!R3where T([x1\\nx2])\\n=2\\n4x2\\n1\\n2x1\\nx1x23\\n5:\\nNotice that this takes 2D vectors as input and returns 3D vectors as out-\\nput.

One might wonder “Why is\\nlinearity important?”, which we’ll address shortly .\\nFirst, consider how we proved the transformation in Example 6.2.4\\nwas linear. W e defined T by matrix multiplication, that is, T(⃗ x) =A⃗ x .\\nW e proved T was linear using properties of matrix multiplication – we\\nnever considered the specific values of A!That is, we didn’t just choose\\na good matrix for T;any matrix A would have worked. This leads us to\\nan important theorem. The first part we have essentially just proved; the\\nsecond part we won’t prove, although its truth is very powerful.\\nTheorem 6.2.1 Matrices and Linear T ransformations\\n1. Define T:Rn!RmbyT(⃗ x) =A⃗ x , where A is an m\\x02n\\nmatrix. Then T is a linear transformation.\\n2. LetT:Rn!Rmbe any linear transformation. Then there\\nexists an unique m\\x02nmatrix A such that T(⃗ x) =A⃗ x .\\nThe second part of the theorem says that al l linear transformations\\ncan be described using matrix multiplication. Given any linear transfor-\\nmation, there is a matrix that completely defines that transformation.\\nThis important matrix gets its own name.\\nDefinition 6.2.2 Standard Matrix of a Linear T ransfor-\\nmation\\nLetT:Rn!Rmbe a linear transformation. By Theorem 6.2.1 ,\\nthere is a matrix A such that T(⃗ x) =A⃗ x . This matrix A is called\\nthe standard matrix of the linear transformation T, and is\\ndenoted [T].\\nWhile exploring all of the ramifications of Theorem 6.2.1 is outside\\nthe scope of this text, let it suffice to say that since 1) linear transfor-\\nmations are very , very important in economics, science, engineering and\\nmathematics, and 2) the theory of matrices is well developed and easy to\\nimplement by hand and on computers, then 3) it is great news that these\\ntwo concepts go hand in hand.\\nW e have already used the second part of this theorem in a small way .\\nIn the previous section we looked at transformations graphically and found\\nthe matrices that produced them. At the time, we didn’t realize that these\\ntransformations were linear, but indeed they were.\\nƉҚƎ The idea that linear transformations\\n“send zero to zero” has an interesting\\nrelation to terminology . The reader\\nis likely familiar with functions like\\nf(x) = 2 x+ 3 and would likely refer\\nto this as a “linear function. ” How-\\never, f(0)̸= 0 , sofisnot “linear” by\\nour new definition of linear. W e erro-\\nneously call f“linear” since its graph\\nproduces a line, though we should\\nbe careful to instead state that “the\\ngraph of fis a line. ” In the context\\nof calculus are only linear transforma-\\ntions if b= 0 . In the case of maps T:\\nRn!Rm, we can similarly consider\\nfunctions of the form T(⃗ x) =A⃗ x+⃗b;\\nsuch functions are again useful in ar-\\neas such as vector calculus, but unless\\n⃗b=⃗0, they are not linear transforma-\\ntions, since T(⃗0) =⃗b.\\nRecall that in Example 6.2.2 , we had\\nto solve a system of equations to de-\\ntermine how to write our given vec-\\ntor in terms of two other vectors for\\nwhich the value of a transformation\\nis known. The advantage of knowing\\nthe values of a transformation on the\\nstandard unit vectors is that we know\\nimmediately how to write any other\\nvector in terms of them.ChapterҚ MatrixTransformaࢢons\\nThis brings us back to the motivating example with which we started\\nthis section. W e tried to find the matrix that translated the unit square one\\nunit to the right. Our attempt failed, and we have yet to determine why .\\nGiven our link between matrices and linear transformations, the answer\\nis likely “the translation transformation is not a linear transformation. ”\\nWhile that is a true statement, it doesn’t really explain things all that\\nwell. Is there some way we could have recognized that this transformation\\nwasn’t linear? (That is, apart from applying the definition directly?)\\nY es, there is. Consider the second part of the linear transformation\\ndefinition. It states that T(k⃗ x) =kT(⃗ x)for all scalars k. If we let k= 0 ,\\nwe have T(0⃗ x) = 0\\x01T(⃗ x), or more simply , T(⃗Ɔ) =⃗Ɔ. That is, if Tis to be\\na linear transformation, it must send the zero vector to the zero vector.\\nThis is a quick way to see that the translation transformation fails to\\nbe linear. By shifting the unit square to the right one unit, the corner at\\nthe point (0;0) was sent to the point (1;0), i.e.,\\nthe vector[0\\n0]\\nwas sent to the vector[1\\n0]\\n:\\nThis property relating to ⃗Ɔis important, so we highlight it here.\\nKey Idea 6.2.1 Linear T ransformations and ⃗Ɔ\\nLetT:Rn!Rmbe a linear transformation.

How do\\nwe systematically find it? W e’ll need a new definition.\\nDefinition 6.2.3 Standard Unit V ectors\\nInRn, the standard unit vectors ⃗ eiare the vectors with a 1in\\ntheithentry and 0s everywhere else.\\nW e’ve already seen these vectors in the previous section.

What made the difference?\\nLook at the entries of T6.2.3(⃗ x)andT6.2.5(⃗ x).T6.2.3 contains entries\\nwhere a variable is squared and where 2 variables are multiplied together\\n– these prevent T6.2.3 from being linear.

If, however, the\\nvectors ⃗ vand⃗ ware linearly independent, then adding the vector ⃗ wgives\\nus a second direction to work with, and V2becomes an object that is\\nstrictly larger than V1. In this case, the visualization is that of a plane\\nthrough the origin.\\nDepending on the size of n, this argument continues.

First,\\nwe will attempt to gain some additional insight into the (initially myste-\\nrious) definition of matrix multiplication by revisiting it from the point\\nof view of linear transformations. W e’ll then introduce two fundamental\\nsubspaces associated with a matrix transformation.\\nMatrix mulࢢplicaࢢon as funcࢢon composiࢢon\\nRecall that one of the ways we can obtain new functions from old ones is\\nvia function composition . Given two functions f(x)andg(x)(where\\nx2R), we can form the compositions\\n(f◦g)(x) =f(g(x)) and\\n(g◦f)(x) =g(f(x));\\nas long as we meet certain conditions on the compatibility of the domains\\nand ranges of the two functions. If you paid attention in high school, you\\nprobably also remember that the order of composition matters: in general,\\n(f◦g)(x)̸= (g◦f)(x):\\nF or example, if f(x) = 2x+ 1 andg(x) =x2, then\\n(f◦g)(x) =f(g(x)) = 2 g(x) + 1 = 2 x2+ 1;\\nwhile\\n(g◦f)(x) =g(f(x)) = ( f(x))2= (2x+ 1)2= 4x2+ 4x+ 1:\\nIn this example, both functions are defined from R toR, and neither is\\na linear transformation in the sense of this section. In fact, if f:R!R\\nsatisfies Definition 6.2.1 , then we must have f(x) = ax for some real\\nnumber a. Ifg(x) =bx is another linear transformation from R toR,\\nnotice that we have\\n(f◦g)(x) =f(g(x)) =a(g(x)) =a(bx) = (ab)x:\\nThus, to compose two linear transformations from R toR, we simply\\nmultiply the constants used to define the transformations.\\nNow, what about a general linear transformation S:Rn!Rm? W e\\nknow that any such transformation is a matrix transformation: we must\\nhave\\nS(⃗ x) =A⃗ x\\nfor any ⃗ x2Rn, where A is an m\\x02nmatrix. Since we’re multiplying an\\nm\\x02nmatrix by an n\\x021matrix, the rules of matrix multiplication ensure\\nthat the output ⃗ y=A⃗ x is an element of Rm.\\nSuppose now that we want to define the composition (S◦T)(⃗ x)for\\nsome other linear transformation T. Recall the following rule of function\\ncomposition:\\nIn order for the composition S◦T to be defined, the range\\nofT must be contained in the domain of S.\\nƉқҚ Қ.Ƌ NullSpaceandColumnSpace\\nThat is, since S◦T is defined by (S◦T)(⃗ x) =S(T(⃗ x)), the vector T(⃗ x)\\n(which by definition is in the range of T) must belong to the domain of S.\\nThis means that we must have T(⃗ x)2Rn, so we have\\nT:Rk!Rn\\nfor some natural number k. On the other hand, we know that if T is a\\nlinear transformation, then Tis defined by matrix multiplication: T(⃗ x) =\\nB⃗ x for some n\\x02kmatrix B.\\nLet us now recall one of the rules of matrix multiplication:\\nF or the matrix product AB to be defined, the number of\\ncolumns of A must equal the number of rows of B.\\nThat is, if A is an m\\x02nmatrix, then B must be an n\\x02kmatrix for\\nsome k. But this is the same conclusion as above! What is the connection?\\nW ell, if we follow the rules for function composition, if T(⃗ x) =B⃗ x and\\nS(⃗ y) =A⃗ y , we must have\\n(S◦T)(⃗ x) =S(T(⃗ x)) =A(T(⃗ x)) =A(B⃗ x) = (AB)⃗ x;\\nwhere the last equality is due to the associative property of matrix multi-\\nplication from Theorem 5.2.1 . Thus, we see that\\nComposition of linear transformations is the same as\\nmultiplication of the corresponding matrices !\\nLooking at things from the point of view of matrix transformations\\ngives us two insights on the nature of matrix multiplication:\\n1. When AandB are both n\\x02nmatrices, the transformations S(⃗ x) =\\nA⃗ x andT(⃗ x) =B⃗ x are both maps from RntoRn, and we can define\\nboth\\n(S◦T)(⃗ x) = (AB)⃗ x\\nand\\n(T◦S)(⃗ x) = (BA)⃗ x:\\nOur experience with functions teaches us that most of the time,\\nS◦T̸=T◦S, so of course it makes sense that AB̸=BA in general!\\n2. The fact that AB is defined only when the number of columns of A\\nmatches the number of rows of B is simply a consequence of the fact\\nthatS◦Tis only defined if the range of Tis a subset of the domain\\nofA.\\nWhat about the “row times column” rule for determining the entries\\nofAB ? Let’s look at how things work in 2D. Suppose we’ve defined linear\\ntransformations\\nS([\\nx\\ny])\\n=A[\\nx\\ny]\\n=[\\na11a12\\na21a22][\\nx\\ny]\\nand\\nT([x\\ny])\\n=B[x\\ny]\\n=[b11b12\\nb21b22][x\\ny]\\n:\\nƉқƍ ChapterҚ MatrixTransformaࢢons\\nIf we write T([x\\ny])\\n=[\\nu\\nv]\\n, where u=b11x+b12yandv=b21x+b22y,\\nthen we have\\n(S◦T)([x\\ny])\\n=S(\\nT([x\\ny]))\\n=S([u\\nv])\\n=[a11a12\\na21a22][u\\nv]\\n=[\\na11u+a12v\\na21u+a22v]\\n=[a11(b11x+b12y) +a12(b21x+b22y)\\na21(b11x+b12y) +a22(b21x+b22y)]\\n=[(a11b11+a12b21)x+ (a11b12+a12b22)y\\n(a21b11+a22b21)x+ (a21b12+a22b22)y]\\n=[a11b11+a12b21a11b12+a12b22\\na21b11+a22b21a21b12+a22b22][x\\ny]\\n:\\nBut we also argued above that we should have\\n(S◦T)([x\\ny])\\n= (AB)[x\\ny]\\n;\\nfrom which we’re forced to conclude that\\nAB =[a11b11+a12b21a11b12+a12b22\\na21b11+a22b21a21b12+a22b22]\\n;\\nand this is exactly the rule for multiplying two 2\\x022matrices! Of course,\\nwe can repeat the above argument for the general case where A ism\\x02n\\nandB isn\\x02k, but you can probably guess that the algebra gets a bit\\nmessy on that one, so we’ll spare you the details.\\nColumn space and null space\\nWhen we discussed the composition of linear transformations above, we\\nbriefly mentioned that this involves the consideration of the range . Recall\\nthat the range of a function is the set of all possible outputs when every\\ninput in the domain is considered. F or example, with the function f(x) =\\nx2, where xcan be any real number, the range is the set of all real numbers\\ny\\x150. (Ify=x2andxis real, then ycan’t be negative.)\\nIf we’re given a linear transformation T:Rn!Rm, we might want\\nto know what sort of vectors ⃗ y2Rmcan be obtained from T. Consider\\nExamples 6.1.2 and 6.1.3 from way back at the beginning of the section.\\nIn Example 6.1.2 , the vectors A⃗ x andA⃗ y were non-parallel, and therefore\\nindependent. It follows that for any other vector ⃗ z2R2, we can find\\nscalars aandbsuch that\\n⃗ z=a(A⃗ x) +b(A⃗ y) =A(a⃗ x) +A(b⃗ y) =A(a⃗ x+b⃗ y);\\nso every vector in R2can be written as the output of the transforma-\\ntionT(⃗ x) =A⃗ x . On the other hand, using the matrix A=[1\\x001\\n1\\x001]\\nin\\nExample 6.1.3 , for any vector[\\na\\nb]\\n2R2, we have\\nA[a\\nb]\\n=[1\\x001\\n1\\x001][a\\nb]\\n=[a\\x00b\\na\\x00b]\\n= (a\\x00b)[1\\n1]\\n;\\nƉққ Note : Although we didn’t say so at\\nthe time, we already encountered this\\nrule for multiplying a vector by a ma-\\ntrix in the argument we gave in sup-\\nport of Theorem 6.2.2 on page 271 .\\nSome textbooks actually use this ob-\\nservation to give an alternative defi-\\nnition of matrix multiplication. Once\\nwe know how the product A⃗ x is de-\\nfined for an m\\x02nmatrix A andn\\x021\\nvector ⃗ x, we can define AB for an n\\x02p\\nmatrix B as follows: first, we write\\nB=[\\n⃗b1⃗b2\\x01 \\x01 \\x01⃗bp]\\n;\\nwhere the n\\x021vectors ⃗b1; : : : ;⃗bpare\\nthe columns of B.

First, if\\nT(⃗ x) =A⃗ x is a linear transformation, we have\\nrange (T) = col(A):\\nSecond, as mentioned in Definition 6.4.1 , since the range of Tcan be writ-\\nten as a span, it is automatically a subspace of Rmaccording to Theorem\\n6.3.1 . The range of a linear transformation is one of the more important\\nexamples of a subspace.\\nT o give a more useful description of the column space, we rely Theorem\\n6.4.1 below, whose proof is too technical for this text. T o help with the\\nƉқƎ ChapterҚ MatrixTransformaࢢons\\nstatement of this theorem, we first introduce one more bit of terminology .\\nW e will call a column of a matrix Aapivot column if the corresponding\\ncolumn in the reduced row echelon form of A contains a leading 1.\\nTheorem 6.4.1 Basis for the column space of a matrix\\nA basis for the column space of an m\\x02nmatrix A is given by the\\nset of pivot columns of A.\\nW e will illustrate Theorem 6.4.1 with an example.

T/F: W e only compute the trace of square matrices.\\n2. T/F: One can tell if a matrix is invertible by computing the trace.\\nIn the previous section, we learned about an operation we can peform\\non matrices, namely the transpose. Given a matrix A, we can “find the\\ntranspose of A,” which is another matrix. In this section we learn about\\na new operation called the trace . It is a different type of operation than\\nthe transpose. Given a matrix A, we can “find the trace of A,” which is\\nnot a matrix but rather a number. W e formally define it here.\\nDefinition 7.2.1 The T race\\nLetA be an n\\x02nmatrix. The trace of A, denoted tr (A), is the\\nsum of the diagonal elements of A. That is,\\ntr(A) =a11+a22+\\x01\\x01\\x01+ann:\\nThis seems like a simple definition, and it really is. Just to make sure\\nit is clear, let’s practice.\\nExample ƍ.Ɖ.ƈ Computing the trace of a matrix\\nFind the trace of A,B,C andI4, where\\nA=[1 2\\n3 4]\\n; B =2\\n41 2 0\\n3 8 1\\n\\x002 7 \\x0053\\n5 andC=[1 2 3\\n4 5 6]\\n:\\nSolution T o find the trace of A, note that the diagonal elements\\nofA are 1 and 4. Therefore, tr (A) = 1 + 4 = 5 .\\nW e see that the diagonal elements of B are 1, 8 and -5, so tr (B) =\\n1 + 8\\x005 = 4 .\\nThe matrix C is not a square matrix, and our definition states that we\\nmust start with a square matrix. Therefore tr (C)is not defined.\\nFinally , the diagonal of I4consists of four 1s. Therefore tr (I4) = 4 .\\nNow that we have defined the trace of a matrix, we should think like\\nmathematicians and ask some questions. The first questions that should\\npop into our minds should be along the lines of “How does the trace\\nwork with other matrix operations?” (Recall that we asked a similar\\nquestion once we learned about the transpose.) W e should think about\\nhow the trace works with matrix addition, scalar multiplication, matrix\\nmultiplication, matrix inverses, and the transpose.\\nW e’ll give a theorem that will formally tell us what is true in a moment,\\nbut first let’s play with two sample matrices and see if we can see what\\nwill happen. Let\\nA=2\\n42 1 3\\n2 0 \\x001\\n3\\x001 33\\n5 andB=2\\n42 0 1\\n\\x001 2 0\\n0 2 \\x0013\\n5:\\nƊƈƈ This example brings to light many in-\\nteresting ideas that we’ll flesh out just\\na little bit here.\\n1. Notice that the elements of A\\nare 1, \\x002, 1 and 1. Add the\\nsquares of these numbers: 12+\\n(\\x002)2+12+12= 7 = tr(ATA).\\nNotice that the elements of B\\nare 6, 7, 11 and -4. Add\\nthe squares of these numbers:\\n62+ 72+ 112+ (\\x004)2= 222 =\\ntr(BTB).\\nCan you see why this is true?\\nWhen looking at multiplying\\nATA, focus only on where the\\nelements on the diagonal come\\nfrom since they are the only\\nones that matter when taking\\nthe trace.\\n2. Y ou can confirm on your\\nown that regardless of the di-\\nmensions of A, tr (ATA) =\\ntr(AAT). T o see why this\\nis true, consider the previous\\npoint. (Recall also that ATA\\nandAATare always square, re-\\ngardless of the dimensions of\\nA.)\\n3. Mathematicians are actually\\nmore interested in√\\ntr(ATA)\\nthan just tr (ATA). The rea-\\nson for this is a bit compli-\\ncated; the short answer is that\\n“it works better. ” The reason\\n“it works better” is related to\\nthe Pythagorean Theorem, all\\nof all things. If we know that\\nthe legs of a right triangle have\\nlength aandb, we are more in-\\nterested inp\\na2+b2than just\\na2+b2. Of course, this ex-\\nplanation raises more questions\\nthan it answers; our goal here is\\njust to whet your appetite and\\nget you to do some more read-\\ning. A Numerical Linear Alge-\\nbra book would be a good place\\nto start.Chapterƍ OperaࢢonsonMatrices\\nIt should be clear that tr (A) = 5 and tr (B) = 3 . What is tr (A+B)?\\ntr(A+B) = tr0\\n@2\\n42 1 3\\n2 0 \\x001\\n3\\x001 33\\n5+2\\n42 0 1\\n\\x001 2 0\\n0 2 \\x0013\\n51\\nA\\n= tr0\\n@2\\n44 1 4\\n1 2 \\x001\\n3 1 23\\n51\\nA\\n= 8\\nSo we notice that tr (A+B) = tr(A) + tr(B). This probably isn’t a\\ncoincidence.\\nHow does the trace work with scalar multiplication? If we multiply A\\nby 4, then the diagonal elements will be 8, 0 and 12, so tr (4A) = 20 . Is it\\na coincidence that this is 4 times the trace of A?\\nLet’s move on to matrix multiplication. How will the trace of AB\\nrelate to the traces of A andB? Let’s see:\\ntr(AB) = tr0\\n@2\\n42 1 3\\n2 0 \\x001\\n3\\x001 33\\n52\\n42 0 1\\n\\x001 2 0\\n0 2 \\x0013\\n51\\nA\\n= tr0\\n@2\\n43 8 \\x001\\n4\\x002 3\\n7 4 03\\n51\\nA\\n= 1\\nIt isn’t exactly clear what the relationship is among tr (A), tr(B)and\\ntr(AB). Before moving on, let’s find tr (BA):\\ntr(BA) = tr0\\n@2\\n42 0 1\\n\\x001 2 0\\n0 2 \\x0013\\n52\\n42 1 3\\n2 0 \\x001\\n3\\x001 33\\n51\\nA\\n= tr0\\n@2\\n47 1 9\\n2\\x001\\x005\\n1 1 \\x0053\\n51\\nA\\n= 1\\nW e notice that tr (AB) = tr(BA). Is this coincidental?\\nHow are the traces of A andA\\x001related? W e compute A\\x001and find\\nthat\\nA\\x001=2\\n41/17 6/17 1/17\\n9/17 3/17 \\x008/17\\n2/17 \\x005/17 2/173\\n5:\\nTherefore tr (A\\x001) = 6/17 . Again, the relationship isn’t clear.\\nFinally , let’s see how the trace is related to the transpose. W e actually\\ndon’t have to formally compute anything. Recall from the previous section\\nthat the diagonals of A andATare identical; therefore, tr (A) = tr(AT).\\nThat, we know for sure, isn’t a coincidence.\\nW e now formally state what equalities are true when considering the\\ninteraction of the trace with other matrix operations.\\nƊƈƉ There are many different measure-\\nments of a matrix size. In this text,\\nwe just refer to its dimensions. Some\\nmeasurements of size refer the mag-\\nnitude of the elements in the matrix.\\nThe next section describes yet an-\\nother measurement of matrix size.ƍ.Ɖ TheMatrixTrace\\nTheorem 7.2.1 Properties of the Matrix T race\\nLetA andB ben\\x02nmatrices.

The reason for the\\nsilence in these areas is that there simply is not a relationship.\\nW e end this section by again wondering why anyone would care about\\nthe trace of matrix. One reason mathematicians are interested in it is that\\nit can give a measurement of the “size” of a matrix.\\nConsider the following 2\\x022matrices:\\nA=[1\\x002\\n1 1]\\nandB=[6 7\\n11\\x004]\\n:\\nThese matrices have the same trace, yet B clearly has bigger elements\\nin it.

The determinant of A can be computed\\nusing cofactor expansion along any row or column of A.\\nW e alluded to this fact way back after Example 7.3.3 . W e had just\\nlearned what cofactor expansion was and we practised along the second\\nrow and down the third column. Later, we found the determinant of\\nthis matrix by computing the cofactor expansion along the first row. In\\nall three cases, we got the number 0. This wasn’t a coincidence. The\\nabove theorem states that all three expansions were actually computing\\nthe determinant.\\nHow does this help us? By giving us freedom to choose any row or\\ncolumn to use for the expansion, we can choose a row or column that\\nlooks “most appealing. ” This usually means “it has lots of zeros. ” W e\\ndemonstrate this principle below.\\nExample ƍ.Ƌ.ƈ Computing a 4\\x024determinant\\nFind the determinant of\\nA=2\\n6641 2 0 9\\n2\\x003 0 5\\n7 2 3 8\\n\\x004 1 0 23\\n775:\\nSolution Our first reaction may well be “Oh no!

Remember,\\nmathematicians see something new and often ask “How does this relate to\\nthings I already know?” So now we ask, “If we change a matrix in some\\nway , how is its determinant changed?”\\nThe standard way that we change matrices is through elementary row\\noperations. If we perform an elementary row operation on a matrix, how\\nwill the determinant of the new matrix compare to the determinant of the\\noriginal matrix?\\nLet’s experiment first and then we’ll officially state what happens.\\nExample ƍ.Ƌ.Ɗ Row operations and determinants\\nLet\\nA=[1 2\\n3 4]\\n:\\nLetB be formed from A by doing one of the following elementary row\\noperations:\\n1.2R1+R2!R2\\n2.5R1!R1\\n3.R1$R2\\nFind det (A)as well as det (B)for each of the row operations above.\\nSolution It is straightforward to compute det (A) =\\x002.\\nLetB be formed by performing the row operation in 1) on A; thus\\nB=[1 2\\n5 8]\\n:\\nIt is clear that det (B) =\\x002, the same as det (A).\\nNow let B be formed by performing the elementary row operation in\\n2) on A; that is,\\nB=[5 10\\n3 4]\\n:\\nƊƉҚ ƍ.Ƌ ProperࢢesoftheDeterminant\\nW e can see that det (B) =\\x0010, which is 5\\x01det(A).\\nFinally , let B be formed by the third row operation given; swap the\\ntwo rows of A. W e see that\\nB=[3 4\\n1 2]\\nand that det (B) = 2 , which is (\\x001)\\x01det(A).\\nW e’ve seen in the above example that there seems to be a relationship\\nbetween the determinants of matrices “before and after” being changed by\\nelementary row operations. Certainly , one example isn’t enough to base a\\ntheory on, and we have not proved anything yet. Regardless, the following\\ntheorem is true.\\nTheorem 7.4.2 The Determinant and Elementary Row\\nOperations\\nLetA be an n\\x02nmatrix and let B be formed by performing one\\nelementary row operation on A.\\n1. IfB is formed from A by adding a scalar multiple of one row\\nto another, then det (B) = det(A).\\n2. IfB is formed from Aby multiplying one row of Aby a scalar\\nk, then det (B) =k\\x01det(A).\\n3. IfB is formed from A by interchanging two rows of A, then\\ndet(B) =\\x00det(A).\\nLet’s put this theorem to use in a couple of examples.\\nExample ƍ.Ƌ.Ƌ Using row operations to compute a determinant\\nLet\\nA=2\\n41 2 1\\n0 1 1\\n1 1 13\\n5:\\nCompute det (A), then find the determinants of the following matrices by\\ninspection using Theorem 7.4.2 .\\nB=2\\n41 1 1\\n1 2 1\\n0 1 13\\n5C=2\\n41 2 1\\n0 1 1\\n7 7 73\\n5D=2\\n41\\x001\\x002\\n0 1 1\\n1 1 13\\n5\\nSolution Computing det (A)by cofactor expansion down the first\\ncolumn or along the second row seems like the best choice, utilizing the\\none zero in the matrix.

There are different ways to describe what happened; saying R1$R2\\nwas followed by R1$R3produces B from A. Since there were two row\\nswaps, det (B) = (\\x001)(\\x001) det(A) = det(A) = 1 .\\nNotice that C is formed from A by multiplying the third row by 7.\\nThus det (C) = 7\\x01det(A) = 7 .\\nƊƉƍ Chapterƍ OperaࢢonsonMatrices\\nIt takes a little thought, but we can form D from A by the operation\\n\\x003R2+R1!R1.

(This is why mathematicians\\nrarely smile: they are remembering their problems)\\nWhat “problem” did we recently uncover? W e stated in the last chap-\\nter that even computers could not compute the determinant of large ma-\\ntrices with cofactor expansion. How then can we compute the determinant\\nof large matrices?\\nW e just learned two interesting and useful facts about matrix determi-\\nnants. First, the determinant of a triangular matrix is easy to compute:\\njust multiply the diagonal elements. Secondly , we know that given any\\nsquare matrix, we can use elementary row operations to put the matrix\\nin triangular form. W e can then find the determinant of the new matrix\\n(which is easy), and adjust that number by recalling what elementary\\noperations we performed.\\nExample ƍ.Ƌ.Қ Reducing a determinant to triangular form\\nFind the determinant of Aby first putting Ainto a triangular form, where\\nA=2\\n42 4 \\x002\\n\\x001\\x002 5\\n3 2 13\\n5:\\nSolution In putting A into a triangular form, we need not worry\\nabout getting leading 1s, but it does tend to make our life easier as we\\nwork out a problem by hand.

The determinant of B is easy to com-\\npute as it is triangular; det (B) =\\x0016. W e can use this to find det (A).\\nRecall the steps we used to transform A intoB. They are:\\n1\\n2R1!R1\\nR1+R2!R2\\n\\x003R1+R3!R3\\nR2$R3\\nThe first operation multiplied a row of A by1\\n2. This means that the\\nresulting matrix had a determinant that was1\\n2the determinant of A.\\nThe next two operations did not affect the determinant at all. The\\nlast operation, the row swap, changed the sign. Combining these effects,\\nwe know that\\n\\x0016 = det(B) = (\\x001)1\\n2det(A):\\nSolving for det (A)we have that det (A) = 32 .\\nIn practice, we don’t need to keep track of operations where we add\\nmultiples of one row to another; they simply do not affect the determinant.\\nAlso, in practice, these steps are carried out by a computer, and computers\\ndon’t care about leading 1s. Therefore, row scaling operations are rarely\\nused. The only things to keep track of are row swaps, and even then\\nall we care about are the number of row swaps. An odd number of row\\nswaps means that the original determinant has the opposite sign of the\\ntriangular form matrix; an even number of row swaps means they have\\nthe same determinant.\\nIf you find yourself needing to compute a determinant by hand (say ,\\non an exam), it’s a good idea to keep the following principles in mind:\\n1. Stick to row operations of the type Ri+kRj!Rias much as\\npossible: they don ’t change the determinant .\\n2. Getting all the way to triangular form isn’t really necessary . Use\\nrow operations of the above type to create as many zeros as possible\\nin one of the columns, and then expand along that column.\\nT o see how these principles work in practice, let’s repeat Example\\n7.4.6 . This time we’ll focus on creating zeros, but we won’t worry about\\ngetting to triangular form. Since adding a multiple of one row to another\\nƊƉƎ Chapterƍ OperaࢢonsonMatrices\\ndoesn’t change the determinant, we can compute det (A)with a string of\\nequalities, as follows:\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c2 4 \\x002\\n\\x001 2 5\\n3 2 1\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c=\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c0 0 8\\n\\x001 2 5\\n3 2 1\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c(Add 2R2toR1)\\n= 0 + 0 + 8( \\x001)1+3\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x001\\x002\\n3 2\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c(ExpandalongRowƈ)\\n= 8((\\x001)(2)\\x00(\\x002)(3))\\n= 8(4) = 32 :\\nOf course, in this case we got lucky and ended up with two zeros in the\\nfirst row after one row operation. However, had this not been the case,\\nwe would have simply done one more row operation ( R3+ 3R2!R3)\\nto create a second zero in the first column, and then done a cofactor\\nexpansion along that column.\\nF or larger determinants, we can follow the same routine: create zeros\\nin one column, expand along that column to get a smaller determinant,\\nand repeat.\\nLet’s think some more like a mathematician. How does the determi-\\nnant work with other matrix operations that we know?

In this\\nsituation, the entries of the matri-\\nces are functions, not numbers, and\\nhence computing determinants is eas-\\nier than using Gaussian elimination.\\nAgain, though, as the matrices get\\nlarge, other solution methods are re-\\nsorted to.ƍ.ƌ ApplicaࢢonsoftheDeterminant\\nW e learned in Section 7.4 that when considering a linear system A⃗ x=⃗b\\nwhere A is square, if det (A)̸= 0 then A is invertible and A⃗ x =⃗bhas\\nexactly one solution. W e also stated in Key Idea 5.5.1 that if det (A) = 0 ,\\nthen A is not invertible and so therefore either A⃗ x =⃗bhas no solution\\nor infinite solutions. Our method of figuring out which of these cases\\napplied was to form the augmented matrix[\\nA⃗b]\\n, put it into reduced\\nrow echelon form, and then interpret the results.\\nCramer’s Rule specifies that det (A)̸= 0 (so we are guaranteed a so-\\nlution). When det (A) = 0 we are not able to discern whether infinite\\nsolutions or no solution exists for a given vector ⃗b. Cramer’s Rule is only\\napplicable to the case when exactly one solution exists.\\nW e end this section with a practical consideration. W e have mentioned\\nbefore that finding determinants is a computationally intensive operation.\\nT o solve a linear system with 3 equations and 3 unknowns, we need to\\ncompute 4 determinants. Just think: with 10 equations and 10 unknowns,\\nwe’d need to compute 11 really hard determinants of 10\\x0210 matrices!\\nThat is a lot of work!\\nThe upshot of this is that Cramer’s Rule makes for a poor choice in\\nsolving numerical linear systems. It simply is not done in practice; it is\\nhard to beat Gaussian elimination.\\nSo why include it? Because its truth is amazing. The determinant\\nis a very strange operation; it produces a number in a very odd way . It\\nshould seem incredible to the reader that by manipulating determinants\\nin a particular way , we can solve linear systems.\\nThe Adjugate Formula\\nRecall that Theorem 5.4.4 in Section 5.4 gave us a “shortcut” for comput-\\ning the inverse of a 2\\x022matrix A=[a b\\nc d]\\n: as long as det (A)̸= 0 , we\\nhave\\nA\\x001=1\\ndet(A)[d\\x00b\\n\\x00c a]\\n:\\nThis result can be easily verified by checking that AA\\x001=I2as required.\\nThe reader may have wondered if there is a similar formula for A\\x001for\\na general n\\x02n matrix A, and whether or not such a formula would\\nstill constitute a “shortcut” . The results here are mixed. Y es, there’s a\\nformula, and we will present it shortly . However, as with Cramer’s rule,\\nit is not a shortcut. The reasons are the same as those we just mentioned\\nfor Cramer’s rule: as long as we’re dealing with a matrix whose entries\\nare numbers, computing the inverse using row operations is vastly more\\nefficient.\\nW e begin with a definition.\\nƊƊƍ Here we see exactly why we want to\\ntake the transpose in our definition\\nof adj (A): when we multiply matri-\\nces, we multiply rows times columns,\\nand taking the transpose ensures that\\neach column of adj (A)is the corre-\\nsponding row of cof (A).Chapterƍ OperaࢢonsonMatrices\\nDefinition 7.5.1 The adjugate of a matrix\\nLetA be an n\\x02nmatrix.\\n• The matrix of cofactors ofA is the n\\x02nmatrix\\ncof(A) = [Cij]\\nwhose (i; j)-entry is given by the (i; j)-cofactor of A.\\n• The adjugate ofA is the n\\x02nmatrix\\nadj(A) = ( cof(A))T= [Cij]T:\\nThus to obtain the matrix of cofactors for A, we replace each entry\\nofA by the corresponding cofactor. T aking the transpose of this matrix\\nproduces the adjugate of A.\\nWhy do we care about the adjugate matrix? Consider the product\\nA\\x01adj(A):\\nA\\x01adj(A) =2\\n6664a11a12\\x01\\x01\\x01a1n\\na21a22\\x01\\x01\\x01a2n\\n............\\nan1an2\\x01\\x01\\x01ann3\\n77752\\n6664C11C21\\x01\\x01\\x01Cn1\\nC12C22\\x01\\x01\\x01Cn2\\n............\\nC1nC2n\\x01\\x01\\x01Cnn3\\n7775\\n(Notice that the indices for adj (A)are reversed, since we took the trans-\\npose of the cofactor matrix.

W e find that the (i; i)-entry is\\nai1Ci1+ai2Ci2+\\x01\\x01\\x01+ainCin:\\nBut this is just the cofactor expansion of det (A)along the ithrow! Thus,\\nthe (i; i)entry of A\\x01adj(A)is simply det (A). This tells us what the\\ndiagonal is. What about the off-diagonal entries?\\nWhen i̸=j, we have the (i; j)-entry\\nai1Cj1+ai2Cj2+\\x01\\x01\\x01+ainCjn:\\nThis is no longer a cofactor expansion for the determinant of A, since\\nwe’re taking entries from one row of A, and cofactors from another. This\\nis, however, a cofactor expansion for the determinant of the matrix B that\\nwe obtain if we replace Row jofA with another copy of Row i. (T ake a\\nmoment to think about why this is true.) But this means that the matrix\\nB has two identical rows, and using Theorem 7.4.2 , we can see that we\\nmust have det (B) = 0 .

However, we want ⃗ x to be an eigenvector and, by the\\ndefinition, eigenvectors cannot be ⃗Ɔ.\\nThis means that we want solutions to (A\\x00\\x15I)⃗ x=⃗Ɔother than ⃗ x=⃗Ɔ.\\nRecall that Theorem 5.4.5 says that if the matrix (A\\x00\\x15I)is invertible,\\nthen the only solution to (A\\x00\\x15I)⃗ x=⃗Ɔis⃗ x=⃗Ɔ. Therefore, in order to\\nhave other solutions, we need (A\\x00\\x15I)to not be invertible.\\nFinally , recall from Theorem 7.4.4 that noninvertible matrices all have\\na determinant of 0. Therefore, if we want to find eigenvalues \\x15and eigen-\\nvectors ⃗ x, we need det (A\\x00\\x15I) = 0 .\\nLet’s start our practice of this theory by finding \\x15such that det (A\\x00\\n\\x15I) = 0 ; that is, let’s find the eigenvalues of a matrix.\\nExample қ.ƈ.ƈ Computing the eigenvalues of a matrix\\nFind the eigenvalues of A, that is, find \\x15such that det (A\\x00\\x15I) = 0 , where\\nA=[1 4\\n2 3]\\n:\\nSolution (Note that this is the matrix we used at the beginning\\nof this section.)

The trace of A is 6; the trace of B is 4.\\n5. The determinant of A is\\x0072; the determinant of B is\\x006.\\nNow that we have completed the “grunt work,” let’s analyze the results\\nof the previous example. W e are looking for any patterns or relationships\\nthat we can find.\\nThe eigenvalues and eigenvectors of AandA\\x001.\\nIn our example, we found that the eigenvalues of Aare\\x006and 12; the\\neigenvalues of A\\x001are\\x001/6 and 1/12 . Also, the eigenvalues of B are\\x001,\\n2 and 3, whereas the eigenvalues of B\\x001are\\x001,1/2 and 1/3 . There is\\nan obvious relationship here; it seems that if \\x15is an eigenvalue of A, then\\n1/\\x15will be an eigenvalue of A\\x001. W e can also note that the corresponding\\neigenvectors matched, too.\\nWhy is this the case? Consider an invertible matrix A with eigenvalue\\n\\x15̸= 0 and eigenvector ⃗ x. Then, by definition, we know that A⃗ x =\\x15⃗ x .\\nNow multiply both sides by A\\x001:\\nA⃗ x=\\x15⃗ x\\nA\\x001A⃗ x=A\\x001\\x15⃗ x\\n⃗ x=\\x15A\\x001⃗ x\\n1\\n\\x15⃗ x=A\\x001⃗ x\\nW e have just shown that A\\x001⃗ x= 1/\\x15⃗ x ; this, by definition, shows that\\n⃗ xis an eigenvector of A\\x001with eigenvalue 1/ \\x15. This explains the result\\nwe saw above. Of course, this all falls apart if \\x15= 0 , but this is impossible\\nfor an invertible matrix: see Theorem 8.2.2 below.\\nThe eigenvalues and eigenvectors of AandAT.\\nOur example showed that A andAThad the same eigenvalues but\\ndifferent (but somehow similar) eigenvectors; it also showed that B and\\nBThad the same eigenvalues but unrelated eigenvectors. Why is this?\\nW e can answer the eigenvalue question relatively easily; it follows from\\nthe properties of the determinant and the transpose. Recall the following\\ntwo facts:\\n1.(A+B)T=AT+BT(Theorem 7.1.1 ) and\\n2. detA= detAT(Theorem 7.4.4 ).\\nƊҚƉ Note: the reader would be justified\\nin wondering about the case where A\\nis a real matrix with complex eigen-\\nvalues. Any such eigenvalues will\\narise from irreducible quadratic fac-\\ntors of the characteristic polynomial,\\nand we know from Theorem 2.1.3 that\\nthe complex zeros of a quadratic with\\nreal coefficients occur in conjugate\\npairs. That is, if \\x15is a complex eigen-\\nvalue of A, so is the complex conju-\\ngate\\x15. When we multiply the eigen-\\nvalues of A together, the product will\\ncontain \\x15\\x01\\x15=j\\x15j2, which is always\\na real number. Thus, it is always\\ntrue that det (A)is equal to the prod-\\nuct of the eigenvalues of A, provided\\nthat we include any possible complex\\neigenvalues.қ.Ɖ ProperࢢesofEigenvaluesandEigenvectors\\nW e find the eigenvalues of a matrix by computing the characteristic\\npolynomial; that is, we find det A\\x00\\x15I .

Therefore they have the same eigenvalues.\\nWhat about their respective eigenvectors? Is there any relationship?\\nThe simple answer is “No. ”\\nThe eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Aand The Trace.\\nNote that the eigenvalues of A are\\x006and 12, and the trace is 6; the\\neigenvalues of B are\\x001, 2 and 3, and the trace of B is 4. Do we notice\\nany relationship?\\nIt seems that the sum of the eigenvalues is the trace! Why is this the\\ncase?\\nThe answer to this is a bit out of the scope of this text; we can justify\\npart of this fact, and another part we’ll just state as being true without\\njustification.\\nSuppose Ais an n\\x02nmatrix with no complex eigenvalues (that is, the\\ncharacteristic polynomial can be completely factored over the real num-\\nbers). When this is the case, it turns out that we can find a square matrix\\nP such that P\\x001AP is an upper triangular matrix with the eigenvalues of\\nA on the diagonal. (W e unfortunately do not have the time to prove this,\\nor to explain how the matrix P is determined.)\\nNow, recall from Theorem 7.2.1 that tr (AB) = tr(BA). Since P\\x001AP\\nis upper-triangular, we know that tr (P\\x001AP)is the sum of the eigenvalues;\\nalso, using our Theorem 7.2.1 , we know that tr (P\\x001AP) = tr(P\\x001PA) =\\ntr(A). Thus the trace of Ais the sum of the eigenvalues. It turns out that\\nthis result remains true when A has complex eigenvalues, and the proof\\nis similar, except that the entries of the matrix Pwill be complex numbers.\\nThe eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Aand The Determinant.\\nAgain, the eigenvalues of A are\\x006and 12, and the determinant of A\\nis\\x0072. The eigenvalues of B are\\x001, 2 and 3; the determinant of B is\\x006.\\nIt seems as though the product of the eigenvalues is the determinant.\\nThis is indeed true; we defend this with our argument from above. W e\\nknow that the determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of the\\ndiagonal elements. Therefore, given a matrix A, we can find P such that\\nP\\x001AP is upper triangular with the eigenvalues of A on the diagonal.\\nThus det P\\x001AP is the product of the eigenvalues. Using Theorem 7.4.4 ,\\nwe know that det P\\x001AP = detP\\x001PA = detA. Thus the determinant\\nofA is the product of the eigenvalues.\\nW e summarize the results of our example with the following theorem.\\nƊҚƊ Chapterқ EigenvaluesandEigenvectors\\nTheorem 8.2.1 Properties of Eigenvalues and Eigenvec-\\ntors\\nLetA be an n\\x02ninvertible matrix.

W e know this only happens when A is not invertible.\\nSo if A is invertible, there is no nontrivial solution to A⃗ x =⃗Ɔ, and\\nhence 0 is not an eigenvalue of A. IfA is not invertible, then there is a\\nnontrivial solution to A⃗ x =⃗Ɔ, and hence 0 is an eigenvalue of A. This\\nleads us to our final addition to the Invertible Matrix Theorem.\\nTheorem 8.2.2 Invertible Matrix Theorem\\nLetAbe an n\\x02nmatrix. The following statements are equivalent.\\n(a)A is invertible.\\n(h)A does not have an eigenvalue of 0.\\nThis section is about the properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\\nOf course, we have not investigated all of the numerous properties of\\neigenvalues and eigenvectors; we have just surveyed some of the most\\ncommon (and most important) concepts. One of the more important\\ntopics – which you will encounter if you continue on to Math 3410 – is\\nthe question of diagonalization . F or some n\\x02nmatrices A, it is possible\\nto find an invertible matrix P such that P\\x001AP is a diagonal matrix,\\nand the diagonal entries of this matrix are precisely the eigenvalues of A.\\nWhen is this possible? When is it not? T o a large extent, this comes down\\nto the question of multiplicity : when we have a repeated eigenvalue, how\\nmany independent eigenvectors are associated with it?\\nFinally , we have found the eigenvalues of matrices by finding the\\nroots of the characteristic polynomial. W e have limited our examples to\\nquadratic and cubic polynomials; one would expect for larger sized matri-\\nces that a computer would be used to factor the characteristic polynomials.\\nHowever, in general, this is not how the eigenvalues are found. F actoring\\nhigh order polynomials is too unreliable, even with a computer – round off\\nerrors can cause unpredictable results. Also, to even compute the charac-\\nteristic polynomial, one needs to compute the determinant, which is also\\nexpensive (as discussed in the previous chapter).\\nSo how are eigenvalues found? There are iterative processes that can\\nprogressively transform a matrix A into another matrix that is almost an\\nupper triangular matrix (the entries below the diagonal are almost zero)\\nwhere the entries on the diagonal are the eigenvalues.

(At the end of this section,\\nwe’ll discuss the fact that from the point of view of linear transformations,\\nsimilar matrices describe the same linear transformation, if we represent\\nthat linear transformation using different choices of basis.)

Previously , we\\nused the definition\\npA(\\x15) = det(A\\x00\\x15I)\\nfor the characteristic polynomial of a matrix A. W e will adjust this in two\\nways: first, we will use xas the variable in our polynomial; second, we\\nwill shift the sign of the characteristic polynomial and make the following\\ndefinition:\\nDefinition 8.3.2 Characteristic Polynomial (revised def-\\ninition)\\nThe characteristic polynomial of an n\\x02nmatrix Ais the degree-\\nnpolynomial pA(x)defined by\\npA(x) = det(xI\\x00A):\\nNotice that we are using xI\\x00A rather than A\\x00xI . This guarantees\\nthat the highest-degree term in pA(x)is always xn(with coefficient 1),\\nwhereas before this term was \\x06xn, depending on whether nis even or\\nodd. W e are using xas our variable to make it easier to talk about factors\\nof the characteristic polynomial: with this change, the statements “ \\x15is\\nan eigenvalue of A” and “ (x\\x00\\x15)is a factor of pA(x)” are equivalent.\\nIn the previous sections, we saw examples of matrices whose charac-\\nteristic polynomial had a repeated root. In such cases, it is sometimes\\npossible (but not guaranteed) that there is more than one independent\\neigenvector associated with the repeated eigenvalue. Indeed, consider the\\nmatrices\\nA=2\\n42 0 0\\n0 2 0\\n0 0 23\\n5; B =2\\n42 0 0\\n0 2 1\\n0 0 23\\n5; C =2\\n42 1 0\\n0 2 1\\n0 0 23\\n5:\\nAll three matrices are upper-triangular, so they have the same character-\\nistic polynomial, namely:\\np(x) = (x\\x002)3:\\nNotice that the eigenvalue \\x15= 2 is “repeated”, in the sense that it is a\\nrepeated root of the characteristic polynomial. This leads to the following\\ndefinition:\\nDefinition 8.3.3 Algebraic Multiplicity of an Eigenvalue\\nW e say that \\x15is an eigenvalue with algebraic multiplicity kif\\n(x\\x00\\x15)kis a factor of pA(x), but (x\\x00\\x15)k+1is not.\\nIn other words, the algebraic multiplicity of an eigenvalue \\x15 is the\\n(largest) power to which the corresponding factor (x\\x00\\x15)appears in the\\ncharacteristic polynomial. In our example above, all three of the matrices\\nƊҚƎ Chapterқ EigenvaluesandEigenvectors\\nA,B, and C have the eigenvalue 2with algebraic multiplicity 3. However,\\nconsider the corresponding eigenvectors in each case:\\nF orA=2\\n42 0 0\\n0 2 0\\n0 0 23\\n5, we have A\\x002I= 0 , so every non-zero vector ⃗ x\\nis an eigenvector. Indeed, A= 2I, so\\nA⃗ x= (2I)⃗ x=I(2⃗ x) = 2⃗ x\\nfor every vector. In particular, we can choose the standard unit basis\\nvectors\\n⃗ e1=2\\n41\\n0\\n03\\n5;⃗ e2=2\\n40\\n1\\n03\\n5;⃗ e3=2\\n40\\n0\\n13\\n5\\nas our basic eigenvectors, and we see that there are three independent\\neigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue \\x15= 2 .\\nF orB=2\\n42 0 0\\n0 2 1\\n0 0 23\\n5, we have B\\x002I=2\\n40 0 0\\n0 0 1\\n0 0 03\\n5, which is row-\\nequivalent to2\\n40 0 1\\n0 0 0\\n0 0 03\\n5.

Thus, in this case we have two independent\\nbasic eigenvectors, given by the standard unit basis vectors ⃗ e1and⃗ e2.\\nFinally , for C=2\\n42 1 0\\n0 2 1\\n0 0 23\\n5 have have C\\x002I=2\\n40 1 0\\n0 0 1\\n0 0 03\\n5, which\\nis already in reduced-row echelon form.

T o quantify this\\nsituation, we introduce further terminology . First, we make a definition:\\nthe null space of an n\\x02nmatrix A is the set defined by\\nnull(A) =f⃗ x2RnjA⃗ x=⃗0g:\\nIn this language, we note that every eigenvector associated to an eigenvalue\\n\\x15belongs to the null space of A\\x00\\x15I . Indeed, null (A\\x00\\x15I)is equal to the\\nset of all eigenvectors associated to the eigenvalue \\x15, along with the zero\\nvector. This leads to another definition:\\nƊƍƇ қ.Ɗ EigenvaluesandDiagonalizaࢢon\\nDefinition 8.3.4 Eigenspace\\nLetA be an n\\x02nmatrix, and let \\x15be any real number. The\\n\\x15-eigenspace ofA, denoted by E(A; \\x15 ), is defined by\\nE(A; \\x15 ) = null(A\\x00\\x15I):\\nA couple of remarks on this definition are in order. First, notice that\\n\\x15is not assumed to be an eigenvalue in the definition above. However, for\\nany real number \\x15which is not an eigenvalue, we have\\nE(A; \\x15 ) =f⃗0g:\\nThe eigenvalues of Acan thus be described as those real numbers for which\\nE(A; \\x15 )̸=f⃗0g.

A linear recurrence is a process that\\noccurs in discrete steps, such that the state of the system at any step k\\ndepends linearly on the state of the system after the previous step. An\\nexample might be a population model for an ecosystem involving several\\nspecies. F or a simple two-species “predator-prey” model, we might have\\ntwo populations P1(of rabbits, perhaps?) and P2(let’s say these are\\nfoxes) where the populations at a time tksatisfy a relationship such as\\nP1(tk) =aP1(tk\\x001) +bP2(tk\\x001)\\nP2(tk) =cP1(tk\\x001) +dP2(tk\\x001):\\nA reasonable model would probably have positive values for the coefficients\\naandd(absent competition, predators, etc. we expect the populations to\\nincrease), while bwould be negative (more foxes mean fewer rabbits) and\\ncwould be positive (more rabbits provide more fox food). If we introduce\\na “population vector” ⃗P(t) =[\\nP1(t)\\nP2(t)]\\nto describe the situation at a time\\nt, then the above system can be written in the form ⃗P(tk) =A⃗P(tk\\x001),\\nwhere A=[a b\\nc d]\\n.\\nƊƍƉ қ.Ɗ EigenvaluesandDiagonalizaࢢon\\nNow, given an initial population state ⃗P(t0), we might want to know\\nwhat to expect after several generations (or seasons, or some other rea-\\nsonable unit of time). Notice that we have\\n⃗P(t1) =A⃗P(t0)\\n⃗P(t2) =A⃗P(t1) =A(A⃗P(t0)) =A2⃗P(t0)\\n⃗P(t3) =A⃗P(t2) =A(A2⃗P(t0)) =A3⃗P(t0)\\n......\\n⃗P(tk) =Ak⃗P(t0):\\nThus, to model the time evolution of our system, it suffices to compute\\npowers of our matrix A. If we want to study a system over long periods of\\ntime, we need to be able to compute large powers of our matrix, and for\\ncomplex systems, being able to do so efficiently will become increasingly\\nimportant. (F or example, we may be interested in whether or not the\\nsystem settles into an equilibrium state. This would be the case, for\\nexample, if we were able to show that Akwas approximately equal to the\\nidentity matrix for large values of k.)\\nOne case where this is easily done is when the initial state ⃗P0=⃗P(t0)\\nis an eigenvector for our matrix: if A⃗P0=\\x15⃗P0, then we have\\nA2⃗P0=A(A⃗P0) =A(\\x15⃗P0) =\\x15(A⃗P0) =\\x15(\\x15⃗P0) =\\x152⃗P0\\nA3⃗P0=A(A2⃗P0) =A(\\x152⃗P0) =\\x152(A⃗P0) =\\x152(\\x15⃗P0) =\\x153⃗P0;\\nand so on: in general, Ak⃗P0=\\x15k⃗P0. This is useful, since computing\\npowers of a number is much simpler than computing powers of a matrix.\\nWhat if the initial state is not an eigenvector? It turns out that the\\nsame trick works as long as ⃗P0can be written as a linear combination of\\neigenvectors: suppose that\\n⃗P0=c1⃗ x1+c2⃗ x2+\\x01\\x01\\x01+ck⃗ xk;\\nwhere ⃗ x1; ⃗ x2; : : : ; ⃗ x kare eigenvectors of A with eigenvalues \\x151; \\x152; : : : ; \\x15 k,\\nrespectively . (Note that at this point we’ve moved away from the original\\npremise of a 2\\x022matrix A to consider a more general situation.) In this\\ncase, for any natural number n, we have\\nAn⃗P0=An(c1⃗ x1+c2⃗ x2+\\x01\\x01\\x01+ck⃗ xk)\\n=c1(An⃗ x1) +c2(An⃗ x2) +\\x01\\x01\\x01+ck(An⃗ xk)\\n=c1(\\x15n\\n1⃗ x1) +c2(\\x15n\\n2⃗ x2) +\\x01\\x01\\x01+ck(\\x15n\\nk⃗ xk);\\nusing our previous result. Again, we only need to be able to compute\\npowers of the eigenvalues, and not of the original matrix.\\nWith the above in mind, we will clearly be in an advantageous situation\\nif we can guarantee that every vector in our space can be written as a\\nlinear combination of eigenvectors.

Then, multiplying both sides of (қ.ƈ)on the\\nleft by A, we must have\\nA⃗ xm+1=A(c1⃗ x1+c2⃗ x2+\\x01\\x01\\x01+cm⃗ xm) =c1(A⃗ x1)+c2(A⃗ x2)+\\x01\\x01\\x01+cm(A⃗ xm);\\nbut each vector ⃗ xiis an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue \\x15i. Thus,\\n\\x15m+1⃗ xm+1=c1\\x151⃗ x1+c2\\x152⃗ x2+\\x01\\x01\\x01+cm\\x15m⃗ xm:\\nOn the other hand, if we multiply both sides of (қ.ƈ)by the scalar \\x15m+1 ,\\nwe have\\n\\x15m+1⃗ xm+1=c1\\x15m+1⃗ x1+c2\\x15m+1⃗ x2+\\x01\\x01\\x01+cm\\x15m+1⃗ xm+1:\\nSubtracting these last two equations, we find:\\n⃗0 =c1(\\x15m+1\\x00\\x151)⃗ x1+c2(\\x15m+1\\x00\\x152)⃗ x2+\\x01\\x01\\x01+cm(\\x15m+1\\x00\\x15m)⃗ xm:\\nNow, we are assuming that our eigenvalues are all distinct . Thus, \\x15m+1\\x00\\n\\x15i̸= 0 for all i= 1;2; : : : ; m . On the other hand, the vectors ⃗ x1; ⃗ x2; : : : ; ⃗ x m\\nare assumed to be linearly independent, so we must have\\nc1(\\x15m+1\\x00\\x151) = 0; c2(\\x15m+1\\x00\\x152) = 0; : : : ; c m(\\x15m+1\\x00\\x15m) = 0:\\nSince none of the \\x15m+1\\x00\\x15iterms vanish, it must be the case that c1=\\nc2=\\x01\\x01\\x01=cm= 0 . But if that is true, then\\n⃗ xm+1= 0⃗ x1+ 0⃗ x2+\\x01\\x01\\x01+ 0⃗ xm=⃗0;\\nwhich is impossible, since ⃗ xm+1 was assumed to be an eigenvector, and\\neigenvectors are nonzero. Thus, it must be the case that all of our eigen-\\nvectors are linearly independent.\\nThe above tells us that any n\\x02nmatrix Awith ndistinct eigenvalues\\nis automatically diagonalizable. There are two other possibilities. One\\nis that the characteristic polynomial of A cannot be completely factored\\nover the real numbers. In this case, diagonalization is impossible, unless\\nwe are willing to consider complex eigenvalues. Recall (from way back\\nin Chapter 2) that over the complex numbers, every polynomial can be\\ncompletely factored. (This is the F undamental Theorem of Algebra.) In\\nthis case, we may still be able to diagonalize, but the eigenvectors corre-\\nsponding to the complex eigenvalues may well be complex themselves, so\\nthe matrix P used to diagonalize A could have complex entries.\\nThe other possibility is that we have repeated eigenvalues. Here, it\\nis possible that we encounter truly insurmountable obstacles. First, we\\nhave the following theorem, which we will state without proof. The inter-\\nested reader can easily find the details in other linear algebra textbooks\\nor online.\\nTheorem 8.3.6 Algebraic versus geometric multiplicity\\nLetA be an n\\x02nmatrix, and for each real number \\x15, letm\\x15(A)\\ndenote the algebraic multiplicity of \\x15. (If\\x15is not an eigenvalue of\\nA, we set m\\x15(A) = 0 .) Then for all numbers \\x15, we have\\ndim null (A\\x00\\x15I)\\x14m\\x15(A):\\nƊƍҚ қ.Ɗ EigenvaluesandDiagonalizaࢢon\\nIn other words, the geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue is always\\nless than or equal to the algebraic multiplicity . Note that the sum of the\\nalgebraic multiplicities is always equal to the degree of the characteristic\\npolynomial, which, in turn, is equal to n, for an n\\x02nmatrix A. On the\\nother hand, the total number of independent eigenvectors for A is equal\\nto the sum of the geometric multiplicities. (W e know that eigenvectors for\\ndifferent eigenvalues are independent, and the geometric multiplicity tells\\nus how many independent eigenvectors we’ll have for a single eigenvalue.)\\nAs a result, we have the following:\\nTheorem 8.3.7 Diagonalization and multiplicities\\nAnn\\x02nmatrix A is diagonalizable if and only if dim null (A) =\\nm\\x15(A)for each eigenvalue \\x15ofA; that is, if the geometric multi-\\nplicity of each eigenvalue is equal to its algebraic multiplicity .\\nThis also tells us exactly when we can expect a matrix to fail to be\\ndiagonalizable: this will be the case if A has an eigenvalue of algebraic\\nmultiplicity greater than 1 for which the geometric multiplicity is less\\nthan the algebraic multiplicity . (That is, if we don’t get “enough” basic\\neigenvectors corresponding to a repeated eigenvalue.)\\nThe reader may wonder if there is anything further that can be said in\\nthe case that a matrix Ais not diagonalizable, and indeed, there is. As long\\nas we are willing to work over the complex numbers (to avoid situations\\nwhere the characteristic polynomial cannot be factored), one can prove\\nthat in the worst-case scenario, there exists an invertible matrix P such\\nthat the matrix P\\x001AP is triangular. (If we can’t get a diagonal matrix,\\nupper or lower-triangular is the next best thing.) The standard form of\\nsuch a matrix is called the Jordan Canonical F orm ; it is obtained using\\nwhat are called generalized eigenvectors . The Jordan Canonical F orm of\\na matrix is studied in more advanced courses in linear algebra.\\nOne last important result that we do not have time to study concerns\\nthe case of symmetric matrices. Recall that an n\\x02nmatrix A is sym-\\nmetric ifAT=A. An important result called the Spectral Theorem\\nguarantees that every symmetric matrix A is diagonalizable. In fact, the\\nspectral theorem goes one step further. Recall that two vectors ⃗ uand⃗ v\\nare orthogonal if⃗ u⃗⃗\\x01⃗ v= 0 . W e say that a set of vectors f⃗ x1; ⃗ x2; : : : ; ⃗ x kgis\\northogonal if⃗ xi̸=⃗0for each i, and ⃗ xi⃗⃗\\x01⃗ xj= 0 for all i̸=j. Orthogonality\\nis a “stronger” condition than linear independence. Indeed, if the vectors\\n⃗ x1; : : : ; ⃗ x kare orthogonal and\\nc1⃗ x1+c2⃗ x2+\\x01\\x01\\x01+ck⃗ xk=⃗0\\nfor some scalars c1; c2; : : : ; c k, taking the dot product of both sides of the\\nabove equation with ⃗ x1gives us\\nc1(⃗ x1⃗⃗\\x01⃗ x1) +c2(0) +\\x01\\x01\\x01+ck(0) = 0 ;\\nand since ⃗ x1⃗⃗\\x01⃗ x1=∥⃗ x1∥2̸= 0 , it must be that c1= 0 , and similarly , all\\nthe other scalars must be zero as well.\\nF or a symmetric matrix, eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigen-\\nvalues are not just independent, they’re orthogonal. Indeed, since ⃗ x1⃗⃗\\x01⃗ x2\\nƊƍƍ Chapterқ EigenvaluesandEigenvectors\\ncan be written as the matrix product ⃗ xT\\n1⃗ x2, we have (using the fact that\\nAT=A):\\n\\x151(⃗ x1⃗⃗\\x01⃗ x2) = (\\x151⃗ x1)T⃗ x2= (A⃗ x1)T⃗ x2= (⃗ xT\\n1AT)⃗ x2=⃗ xT\\n1(A⃗ x2) =⃗ xT\\n1(\\x152⃗ x2) =\\x152(⃗ x1⃗⃗\\x01⃗ x2);\\nThus, (\\x151\\x00\\x152)(⃗ x1⃗⃗\\x01⃗ x2) = 0 , and since \\x151̸=\\x152, we must have ⃗ x1⃗⃗\\x01⃗ x2= 0 .\\nIt is possible to prove that for a symmetric matrix, one can find an\\northogonal basis of eigenvectors. This observation has a number of\\nimportant applications. (T ry an online search for “orthogonal diagonal-\\nization” and you should be able to find several examples.)\\nMatrix similarity and change of basis for transformaࢢons\\nW e end this section with the promised explanation of how similar matrices\\ncan be viewed as different representations of the same linear transforma-\\ntion. If we think of matrices in terms of the matrix transformations they\\ndefine, then two matrix transformations obtained from similar matrices\\nshould be viewed as two descriptions of the same linear transformation\\nusing different “coordinate systems” . Let us explain what we mean here.\\nSuppose\\nT:Rn!Rn\\nis a matrix transformation defined by T(⃗ x) =A⃗ x for some n\\x02nmatrix\\nA. Let us consider this to be a transformation defined in terms of the\\nstandard basis vectors ⃗ e1;⃗ e2; : : : ;⃗ e nforRn. W e can then write\\n⃗ x=[x1x2\\x01\\x01\\x01xn]T=x1⃗ e1+x2⃗ e2+\\x01\\x01\\x01+xn⃗ en\\nand think of T as a function of the variables x1; x2; : : : ; x n. T o put this\\nanother way , when we speak of a matrix transformation with standard\\nmatrix A, that matrix A is defined with respect to the standard basis. In\\ngeneral, let A=f⃗ e1; : : : ;⃗ e ngdenote our standard basis, and suppose\\nB=f⃗b1;⃗b2; : : : ;⃗bng\\nis another basis for Rn. Recall that when we say that the set Bis a basis ,\\nwe mean that span B=Rn, so that every vector in Rncan be written as\\na linear combination of the vectors in B, and B is linearly independent,\\nwhich means that every vector in Rncan be written uniquely as a linear\\ncombination of the vectors in B.\\nLet⃗ v=y1⃗b1+y2⃗b2+\\x01\\x01\\x01+yn⃗bnany vector in Rn.

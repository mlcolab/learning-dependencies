A linear transformation is a function that maps one vector space to another in a way that preserves the linear structure of the vector space. In other words, it preserves the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication. Injective linear transformations, also known as one-to-one linear transformations, are special types of linear transformations that have the property of being injective, which means that they map distinct elements of the input vector space to distinct elements of the output vector space. Understanding linear transformation addition is important for understanding this property of injective linear transformations.\\n\\n', 'conversation_id': '23b2330c-5e70-4d3e-a317-4875f9ddb89a', 'parent_id': 'c29e3a8f-8d3b-4416-9816-1536b24c2fa5'}\n"
